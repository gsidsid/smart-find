LEARNING OBJECTIVES



By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•    Contrast consumer surplus, producer surplus, and social surplus

•    Explain why price floors and price ceilings can be inefficient

•    Analyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism



he familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency. One typical way that 
economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situ- ation of one party without imposing a cost 
on another. Conversely, if a situation is inefficient,
it becomes possible to benefit at least one party without imposing costs on others.

Efficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning: The economy is getting as much benefit as 
possible from its scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved. In other words, the 
optimal amount of each good and service is being produced and con- sumed.

CONSUMER SURPLUS, PRODUCER SURPLUS, SOCIAL SURPLUS

Consider  a  market  for  tablet  computers,  as  shown  in  Figure  1.  The  equilibrium  price  is  $80  and the 
equilibrium quantity is 28 million. To see the benefits to consumers, look at the segment of the demand curve above the 
equilibrium point and to the left. This portion of the demand curve shows that at least some demanders would have been 
willing to pay more than $80 for a tablet.

For example, point J shows that if the price was $90, 20 million tablets would be sold. Those con- sumers who would 
have been willing to pay $90 for a tablet based on the utility they expect to receive from it, but who were able to pay 
the equilibrium price of $80, clearly received a benefit beyond what they had to pay for. Remember, the demand curve 
traces consumers’ willingness to pay for different quantities. The amount that individuals would have been willing to 
pay, minus the amount that they actually paid, is called consumer surplus. Consumer surplus is the area labeled F—that 
is, the area above the market price and below the demand curve.

The supply curve shows the quantity that firms are willing to supply at each price. For example, point K in Figure 1 
illustrates that, at $45, firms would still have been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million. Those producers who 
would have been willing to supply the tablets at $45, but who were

Figure 1. Consumer and Producer Surplus. The somewhat tri- angular area labeled by F shows the area of consumer 
surplus, which shows that the equilibrium price in the market was less than what many of the consumers were willing to 
pay. Point J on the demand curve shows that, even at the price of $90, con- sumers  would  have  been  willing  to  
purchase  a  quantity  of  20 million. The somewhat triangular area labeled by G shows the area of producer surplus, 
which shows that the equilibrium price received in the market was more than what many of the produc- ers were willing 
to accept for their products. For example, point K on the supply curve shows that at a price of $45, firms would have 
been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million.

instead able to charge the equilibrium price of $80, clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to 
supply the product. The amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the seller’s actual cost is called producer 
surplus. In Figure 1, producer surplus is the area labeled G—that is, the area between the market price and the segment 
of the supply curve below the equilibrium.

The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus, also referred to as economic surplus or total 
surplus. In Figure 1, social surplus would be shown as the area F + G. Social surplus is larger at equilibrium quantity 
and price than it would be at any other quantity. This demonstrates the economic efficiency of the market equilibrium. 
In addition, at the efficient level of output, it is impossible to produce greater consumer surplus without reducing 
producer surplus, and it is impos- sible to produce greater producer surplus without reducing consumer surplus.

INEFFICIENCY OF PRICE FLOORS AND PRICE CEILINGS

The imposition of a price floor or a price ceiling will prevent a market from adjusting to its equilib-

rium price and quantity, and thus will create an inefficient outcome. But there is an additional twist here. Along with 
creating inefficiency, price floors and ceilings will also transfer some consumer sur- plus to producers, or some 
producer surplus to consumers.

Imagine that several firms develop a promising but expensive new drug for treating back pain. If this therapy is left 
to the market, the equilibrium price will be $600 per month and 20,000 people will use the drug, as shown in Figure 2 
(a). The original level of consumer surplus is T + U and producer sur- plus is V + W + X. However, the government 
decides to impose a price ceiling of $400 to make the drug more affordable. At this price ceiling, firms in the market 
now produce only 15,000.

As a result, two changes occur. First, an inefficient outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is reduced. The 
loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity is called deadweigftt loss. In 
a very real sense, it is like money thrown away that benefits no one. In Figure 2 (a), the deadweight loss is the area 
U + W. When deadweight loss exists, it is possible for both consumer and producer surplus to be higher, in this case 
because the price control is blocking some suppliers and demanders from transactions they would both be willing to 
make.

A second change from the price ceiling is that some of the producer surplus is transferred to con- sumers. After the 
price ceiling is imposed, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new producer surplus is X. In other words, the 
price ceiling transfers the area of surplus (V) from producers to con- sumers. Note that the gain to consumers is less 
than the loss to producers, which is just another way of seeing the deadweight loss.



















Figure 2. (a) Efficiency and Price Floors and Ceilings. The original equilibrium price is $600 with a quantity of 
20,000. Consumer surplus is T + U, and producer surplus is V + W + X. A price ceiling is imposed at $400, so firms in 
the market now produce only a quantity of 15,000. As a result, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new 
producer surplus is X. (b) The original equilibrium is $8 at a quantity of 1,800. Consumer surplus is G + H + J, and 
producer surplus is I + K. A price floor is imposed at $12, which means that quantity demanded falls to 1,400. As a 
result, the new consumer surplus is G, and the new producer surplus is H + I.

Figure 2 (b) shows a price floor example using a string of struggling movie theaters, all in the same city. The current 
equilibrium is $8 per movie ticket, with 1,800 people attending movies. The original

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   123

consumer surplus is G + H + J, and producer surplus is I + K. The city government is worried that movie theaters will 
go out of business, reducing the entertainment options available to citizens, so it decides to impose a price floor of 
$12 per ticket. As a result, the quantity demanded of movie tickets falls to 1,400. The new consumer surplus is G, and 
the new producer surplus is H + I. In effect, the price floor causes the area H to be transferred from consumer to 
producer surplus, but also causes a deadweight loss of J + K.

This analysis shows that a price ceiling, like a law establishing rent controls, will transfer some pro- ducer surplus 
to consumers—which helps to explain why consumers often favor them. Conversely, a price floor like a guarantee that 
farmers will receive a certain price for their crops will transfer some consumer surplus to producers, which explains 
why producers often favor them. However, both price floors and price ceilings block some transactions that buyers and 
sellers would have been willing to make, and creates deadweight loss. Removing such barriers, so that prices and 
quantities can adjust to their equilibrium level, will increase the economy’s social surplus.

DEMAND AND SUPPLY AS A SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM

The demand and supply model emphasizes that prices are not set only by demand or only by supply, but by the interaction 
between the two. In 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marsftall wrote that asking whether supply or demand determined a 
price was like arguing “whether it is the upper or the under blade of a pair of scissors that cuts a piece of paper.” 
The answer is that both blades of the demand and supply scissors are always involved.

The adjustments of equilibrium price and quantity in a market-oriented economy often occur without much government 
direction or oversight. If the coffee crop in Brazil suffers a terrible frost, then the supply curve of coffee shifts 
to the left and the price of coffee rises. Some people—call them the coffee addicts—continue to drink coffee and pay 
the higher price. Others switch to tea or soft drinks. No government commission is needed to figure out how to adjust 
coffee prices, which companies will be allowed to process the remaining supply, which supermarkets in which cities will 
get how much coffee to sell, or which consumers will ultimately be allowed to drink the brew. Such adjustments in 
response to price changes happen all the time in a market economy, often so smoothly and rapidly that we barely notice 
them.

Think for a moment of all the seasonal foods that are available and inexpensive at certain times of the year, like 
fresh corn in midsummer, but more expensive at other times of the year. People alter their diets and restaurants alter 
their menus in response to these fluctuations in prices without fuss or fanfare. For both the U.S. economy and the 
world economy as a whole, markets—that is, demand and supply—are the primary social mechanism for answering the basic 
questions about what is produced, how it is produced, and for whom it is produced.


WHY CAN WE NOT GET ENOUGH OF ORGANIC?

Organic food is grown without synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers or genetically modified seeds. In recent 
decades, the demand for organic products has increased dramatically. The Organic Trade Association reported sales 
increased from
$1 billion in 1990 to $35.1 billion in 2013, more than 90% of which were sales of food products.
Why, then, are organic foods more expensive than their conventional counterparts? The answer is a clear application of 
the theories of supply and demand. As people have learned more about the harmful effects of chemical fertilizers, 
growth

hormones, pesticides and the like from large-scale factory farming, our tastes and preferences for safer, organic foods 
have increased. This change in tastes has been reinforced by increases in income, which allow people to purchase 
pricier prod- ucts, and has made organic foods more mainstream. This has led to an increased demand for organic foods. 
Graphically, the demand curve has shifted right, and we have moved up the supply curve as producers have responded to 
the higher prices by supplying a greater quantity.
In addition to the movement along the supply curve, we have also had an increase in the number of farmers converting to 
organic farming over time. This is represented by a shift to the right of the supply curve. Since both demand and 
supply have shifted to the right, the resulting equilibrium quantity of organic foods is definitely higher, but the 
price will only fall when the increase in supply is larger than the increase in demand. We may need more time before we 
see lower prices in organic foods. Since the production costs of these foods may remain higher than conventional 
farming, because organic fertilizers and pest management techniques are more expensive, they may never fully catch up 
with the lower prices of non-organic foods.
As a final, specific example: The Environmental Working Group’s “Dirty Dozen” list of fruits and vegetables, which test 
high for pesticide residue even after washing, was released in April 2013. The inclusion of strawberries on the list 
has led to an increase in demand for organic strawberries, resulting in both a higher equilibrium price and quantity of 
sales.


KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

Consumer surplus is the gap between the price that consumers are willing to pay, based on their pref- erences, and the 
market equilibrium price. Producer surplus is the gap between the price for which producers are willing to sell a 
product, based on their costs, and the market equilibrium price. Social surplus is the sum of consumer surplus and 
producer surplus. Total surplus is larger at the equilib- rium quantity and price than it will be at any other quantity 
and price. Deadweight loss is loss in total surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity.

Answers to Self-Cfteck Questions

1.    Assuming that people obey the price ceiling, the market price will be below equilibrium, which means that Qd will 
be more than Qs. Buyers can only buy what is offered for sale, so the number of transactions will fall to Qs. This is 
easy to see graphically. By analogous reasoning, with a price floor the market price will be above the equilibrium 
price, so Qd will be less than Qs. Since the limit on transactions here is demand, the number of transactions will fall 
to Qd. Note that because both price floors and price ceilings reduce the number of transactions, social surplus is 
less.
2.    Because the losses to consumers are greater than the benefits to producers, so the net effect is negative. Since 
the lost consumer surplus is greater than the additional producer surplus, social surplus falls.
