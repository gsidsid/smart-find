LEARNING OBJECTIVES



By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•    Interpret labor-leisure budget constraint graphs

•    Predict consumer choices based on wages and other compensation

•    Explain the backward-bending supply curve of labor



eople  do  not  obtain  utility  just  from  products  they  purchase.  They  also  obtain  utility  from leisure time. 
Leisure time is time not spent at work. The decision-making process of a utility- maximizing household applies to what 
quantity of hours to work in much the same way that it applies to purchases of goods and services. Choices made along 
the labor-leisure budget constraint, as wages shift, provide the logical underpinning for the labor supply curve. The 
discussion also offers some insights about the range of possible reactions when people receive higher wages, and 
specifically about  the  claim  that  if  people  are  paid  higher  wages,  they  will  work  a  greater  quantity  of
hours—assuming that they have a say in the matter.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. workers averaged 38.6 hours per week on the job in 2014. This average 
includes part-time workers; for full-time workers only, the average was 42.5 hours per week. Table 10 shows that more 
than half of all workers are on the job 35 to 48 hours per week, but significant proportions work more or less than 
this amount.

Table 11 breaks down the average hourly compensation received by private industry workers, includ- ing wages and 
benefits. Wages and salaries are about three-quarters of total compensation received by workers; the rest is in the 
form of health insurance, vacation pay, and other benefits. The compensa- tion workers receive differs for many 
reasons, including experience, education, skill, talent, member- ship in a labor union, and the presence of 
discrimination against certain groups in the labor market. Issues surrounding the inequality of incomes in a 
market-oriented economy are explored in the chap- ters on Poverty and Economic Inequality and Issues in Labor Markets: 
Unions, Discrimination, Immi- gration.

THE LABOR-LEISURE BUDGET CONSTRAINT

How do workers make decisions about the number of hours to work? Again, let’s proceed with a con- crete example. The 
economic logic is precisely the same as in the case of a consumption cftoice bud- get constraint, but the labels are 
different on a labor-leisure budget constraint.

Vivian has 70 hours per week that she could devote either to work or to leisure, and her wage is $10/ hour. The lower 
budget constraint in Figure 1 shows Vivian’s possible choices. The horizontal axis of this diagram measures both 
leisure and labor, by showing how Vivian’s time is divided between leisure and labor. Hours of leisure are measured 
from left to right on the horizontal axis, while hours of labor are measured from right to left. Vivian will compare 
choices along this budget constraint, ranging from 70 hours of leisure and no income at point S to zero hours of 
leisure and $700 of income at point L. She will choose the point that provides her with the highest total utility. For 
this example, let’s assume that Vivian’s utility-maximizing choice occurs at O, with 30 hours of leisure, 40 hours of 
work, and $400 in weekly income.

For Vivian to discover the labor-leisure choice that will maximize her utility, she does not have to place numerical 
values on the total and marginal utility that she would receive from every level of income and leisure. All that really 
matters is that Vivian can compare, in her own mind, whether she would prefer more leisure or more income, given the 
tradeoffs she faces. If Vivian can say to herself:

Figure  1.  How  a  Rise  in  Wages  Alters  the  Utility-Maximizing Choice. Vivian’s original choice is point O on the 
lower opportunity set. A rise in her wage causes her opportunity set to swing upward. In response to the increase in 
wages, Vivian can make a range of dif- ferent choices available to her: a choice like D, which involves less work; and 
a choice like B, which involves the same amount of work but more income; or a choice like A, which involves more work 
and considerably more income. Vivian’s personal preferences will deter- mine which choice she makes.

“I’d really rather work a little less and have more leisure, even if it means less income,” or “I’d be will- ing to 
work more hours to make some extra income,” then as she gradually moves in the direction of her preferences, she will 
seek out the utility-maximizing choice on her labor-leisure budget con- straint.

Now imagine that Vivian’s wage level increases to $12/hour. A higher wage will mean a new budget constraint that tilts 
up more steeply; conversely, a lower wage would have led to a new budget con- straint that was flatter. How will a 
change in the wage and the corresponding shift in the budget con- straint affect Vivian’s decisions about how many 
hours to work?

Vivian’s choices of quantity of hours to work and income along her new budget constraint can be divided  into  several  
categories,  using  the  dashed  horizontal  and  vertical  lines  in  Figure  1  that  go through her original choice 
(O). One set of choices in the upper-left portion of the new budget con- straint involves more hours of work (that is, 
less leisure) and more income, at a point like A with 20 hours of leisure, 50 hours of work, and $600 of income (that 
is, 50 hours of work multiplied by the new wage of $12 per hour). A second choice would be to work exactly the same 40 
hours, and to take the benefits of the higher wage in the form of income that would now be $480, at choice B. A third 
choice would involve more leisure and the same income at point C (that is, 33-1/3 hours of work mul- tiplied by the new 
wage of $12 per hour equals $400 of total income). A fourth choice would involve

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   225

less income and much more leisure at a point like D, with a choice like 50 hours of leisure, 20 hours of work, and $240 
in income.

In effect, Vivian can choose whether to receive the benefits of her wage increase in the form of more income, or more 
leisure, or some mixture of these two. With this range of possibilities, it would be unwise to assume that Vivian (or 
anyone else) will necessarily react to a wage increase by working substantially more hours. Maybe they will; maybe they 
will not.

APPLICATIONS OF UTILITY MAXIMIZING WITH THE LABOR-LEISURE BUDGET CONSTRAINT

The theoretical insight that higher wages will sometimes cause an increase in hours worked, some- times cause hours 
worked not to change by much, and sometimes cause hours worked to decline, has led to labor supply curves that look 
like the one in Figure 2. The bottom-left portion of the labor supply curve slopes upward, which reflects the situation 
of a person who reacts to a higher wage by supplying a greater quantity of labor. The middle, close-to-vertical portion 
of the labor supply curve reflects the situation of a person who reacts to a higher wage by supplying about the same 
quantity of labor. The very top portion of the labor supply curve is called a backward-bending supply curve for labor, 
which is the situation of high-wage people who can earn so much that they respond to a still- higher wage by working 
fewer hours. Read the following Clear It Up feature for more on the number of hours the average person works each year.


















Figure 2. A Backward-Bending Supply Curve of Labor. The bottom upward-sloping portion of the labor supply curve shows 
that as wages increase over this range, the quantity of hours worked also increases. The middle, nearly vertical 
portion of the labor supply curve shows that as wages increase over this range, the quantity of hours worked changes 
very little. The backward-bending portion of the labor supply curve at the top shows that as wages increase over this 
range, the quantity of hours worked actually decreases. All three of these possibilities can be derived from how a 
change in wages causes movement in the labor-leisure budget constraint, and thus different choices by individuals.


IS AMERICA A NATION OF WORKAHOLICS?

Americans work a lot. Table 12 shows average hours worked per year in the United States, Canada, Japan, and several 
Euro-

pean countries, with data from 2013. To get a perspective on these numbers, someone who works 40 hours per week for 50 
weeks per year, with two weeks off, would work 2,000 hours per year. The gap in hours worked is a little astonishing; 
the 250 to 300 hour gap between how much Americans work and how much Germans or the French work amounts to roughly six 
to seven weeks less of work per year. Economists who study these international patterns debate the extent to which 
average Americans and Japanese have a preference for working more than, say, Germans, or whether German workers and 
employers face particular kinds of taxes and regulations that lead to fewer hours worked. Many countries have laws that 
regulate the work week and dictate holidays and the standards of “normal” vacation time vary from country to country. 
It is also interesting to take the amount of time spent working in context; it is estimated that in the late nineteenth 
century in the United States, the average work week was over 60 hours per week—leaving little to no time for leisure.

The different responses to a rise in wages—more hours worked, the same hours worked, or fewer hours worked—are patterns 
exhibited by different groups of workers in the U.S. economy. Many full- time workers have jobs where the number of 
hours is held relatively fixed, partly by their own choice and partly by their employer’s practices. These workers do 
not much change their hours worked as wages rise or fall, so their supply curve of labor is inelastic. However, 
part-time workers and younger workers tend to be more flexible in their hours, and more ready to increase hours worked 
when wages are high or cut back when wages fall.

The backward-bending supply curve for labor, when workers react to higher wages by working fewer hours and having more 
income, is not observed often in the short run. However, some well-paid pro- fessionals, like dentists or accountants, 
may react to higher wages by choosing to limit the number of hours, perhaps by taking especially long vacations, or 
taking every other Friday off. Over a long-term perspective, the backward-bending supply curve for labor is common. 
Over the last century, Amer- icans have reacted to gradually rising wages by working fewer hours; for example, the 
length of the average work-week has fallen from about 60 hours per week in 1900 to the present average of less than 40 
hours per week.

Recognizing that workers have a range of possible reactions to a change in wages casts some fresh insight on a 
perennial political debate: the claim that a reduction in income taxes—which would, in effect, allow people to earn 
more per hour—will encourage people to work more. The leisure-income budget set points out that this connection will 
not hold true for all workers. Some people, especially part-timers, may react to higher wages by working more. Many 
will work the same number of hours. Some people, especially those whose incomes are already high, may react to the tax 
cut by working fewer hours. Of course, cutting taxes may be a good or a bad idea for a variety of reasons, not just 
because of its impact on work incentives, but the specific claim that tax cuts will lead people to work

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   227

more hours is only likely to hold for specific groups of workers and will depend on how and for whom taxes are cut.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

When making a choice along the labor-leisure budget constraint, a household will choose the com- bination of labor, 
leisure, and income that provides the most utility. The result of a change in wage levels can be higher work hours, the 
same work hours, or lower work hours.

REVIEW QUESTIONS



1.    How will a utility-maximizer find the choice of leisure and income that provides the greatest utility?
2.    As a general rule, is it safe to assume that a higher wage will encourage significantly more hours worked for all 
individuals? Explain.



CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS



1.    In the labor-leisure choice model, what is the price of leisure?
2.    Think about the backward-bending part of the labor supply curve. Why would someone work less as a result of a 
higher wage rate?
3.    What would be the substitution effect and the income effect of a wage increase?
4.    Visit the BLS website and determine if education level, race/ethnicity, or gender appear to impact labor versus 
leisure choices.

1.    This problem is straightforward if you remember leisure hours plus work hours are limited to 50 hours total. If 
you reverse the order of the last three columns so that more leisure corresponds to less work and income, you can add 
up columns two and five to find utility is maximized at 10 leisure hours and 40 work hours:

Table 15.

Suppose Sid starts with 50 hours of leisure and 0 hours of work. As Sid moves up the table, he trades 10 hours of 
leisure for 10 hours of work at each step. At (40, 10), his MULeisure = 50, which is substantially less than his 
MUIncome of 500. This shortfall signals Sid to keep trading leisure for work/income until at (10, 40) the marginal 
utility of both is equal at 200. This is the sign that he should stop here, confirming the answer in question 1.
