6.4  ELASTICITY  IN  AREAS  OTHER  THAN  PRICE



LEARNING OBJECTIVES



By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•    Calculate the income elasticity of demand and the cross-price elasticity of demand

•    Calculate the elasticity in labor and financial capital markets through an understanding of the elasticity of 
labor supply and the elasticity of savings
•    Apply concepts of price elasticity to real-world situations



he basic idea of elasticity—how a percentage change in one variable causes a percentage change in another variable—does 
not just apply to the responsiveness of supply and demand to changes in the price of a product. Recall that quantity 
demanded (Qd) depends on income, tastes and
preferences, the prices of related goods, and so on, as well as price. Similarly, quantity supplied (Qs) depends on the 
cost of production, and so on, as well as price. Elasticity can be measured for any determinant of supply and demand, 
not just the price.

INCOME ELASTICITY OF DEMAND
The income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the per- centage change in 
income.




For  most  products,  most  of  the  time,  the  income  elasticity  of  demand  is  positive:  that  is,  a  rise  in 
income will cause an increase in the quantity demanded. This pattern is common enough that these goods are referred to 
as normal goods. However, for a few goods, an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good; for 
example, those with a higher income might buy fewer ham- burgers, because they are buying more steak instead, or those 
with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer. When the income elasticity of demand is 
negative, the good is called an inferior good.

The concepts of normal and inferior goods were introduced in Demand and Supply. A higher level of income for a normal 
good causes a demand curve to shift to the right for a normal good, which means that the income elasticity of demand is 
positive. How far the demand shifts depends on the income elasticity of demand. A higher income elasticity means a 
larger shift. However, for an inferior good, that is, when the income elasticity of demand is negative, a higher level 
of income would cause the

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   193

demand curve for that good to shift to the left. Again, how much it shifts depends on how large the (negative) income 
elasticity is.

CROSS-PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND

A change in the price of one good can shift the quantity demanded for another good. If the two goods are complements, 
like bread and peanut butter, then a drop in the price of one good will lead to an increase in the quantity demanded of 
the other good. However, if the two goods are substitutes, like plane tickets and train tickets, then a drop in the 
price of one good will cause people to substitute toward that good, and to reduce consumption of the other good. 
Cheaper plane tickets lead to fewer train tickets, and vice versa.
The cross-price elasticity of demand puts some meat on the bones of these ideas. The term “cross- price” refers to the 
idea that the price of one good is affecting the quantity demanded of a different good.  Specifically, the cross-price 
elasticity  of demand is the percentage change in the quantity  of good A that is demanded as a result of a percentage 
change in the price of good B.



Substitute goods have positive cross-price elasticities of demand: if good A is a substitute for good B, like coffee 
and tea, then a higher price for B will mean a greater quantity consumed of A. Comple- ment goods have negative 
cross-price elasticities: if good A is a complement for good B, like coffee and sugar, then a higher price for B will 
mean a lower quantity consumed of A.

ELASTICITY IN LABOR AND FINANCIAL CAPITAL MARKETS

The concept of elasticity applies to any market, not just markets for goods and services. In the labor market, for 
example, the wage elasticity of labor supply—that is, the percentage change in hours worked  divided  by  the  
percentage  change  in  wages—will  determine  the  shape  of  the  labor  supply curve. Specifically:



The wage elasticity of labor supply for teenage workers is generally thought to be fairly elastic: that is, a certain 
percentage change in wages will lead to a larger percentage change in the quantity of hours worked. Conversely, the 
wage elasticity of labor supply for adult workers in their thirties and forties is thought to be fairly inelastic. When 
wages move up or down by a certain percentage amount, the quantity of hours that adults in their prime earning years 
are willing to supply changes but by a lesser percentage amount.
In markets for financial capital, the elasticity of savings—that is, the percentage change in the quan- tity of savings 
divided by the percentage change in interest rates—will describe the shape of the supply curve for financial capital. 
That is:



Sometimes laws are proposed that seek to increase the quantity of savings by offering tax breaks so that the return on 
savings is higher. Such a policy will increase the quantity if the supply curve for financial capital is elastic, 
because then a given percentage increase in the return to savings will cause a

194                   ERIK  DEAN, JUSTIN  ELARDO, MITCH  GREEN, BENJAMIN  WILSON, SEBASTIAN  BERGER 


higher percentage increase in the quantity of savings. However, if the supply curve for financial capital is highly 
inelastic, then a percentage increase in the return to savings will cause only a small increase in the quantity of 
savings. The evidence on the supply curve of financial capital is controversial but, at least in the short run, the 
elasticity of savings with respect to the interest rate appears fairly inelastic.

EXPANDING THE CONCEPT OF ELASTICITY

The elasticity concept does not even need to relate to a typical supply or demand curve at all. For example,  imagine  
that  you  are  studying  whether  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  should  spend  more money on auditing tax returns. 
The question can be framed in terms of the elasticity of tax collections with respect to spending on tax enforcement; 
that is, what is the percentage change in tax collections derived from a percentage change in spending on tax 
enforcement?

With all of the elasticity concepts that have just been described, some of which are listed in Table 6, the possibility 
of confusion arises. When you hear the phrases “elasticity of demand” or “elasticity of supply,” they refer to the 
elasticity with respect to price. Sometimes, either to be extremely clear or because a wide variety of elasticities are 
being discussed, the elasticity of demand or the demand elas- ticity will be called the price elasticity of demand or 
the “elasticity of demand with respect to price.” Similarly, elasticity of supply or the supply elasticity is sometimes 
called, to avoid any possibility of confusion, the price elasticity of supply or “the elasticity of supply with respect 
to price.” But in what- ever context elasticity is invoked, the idea always refers to percentage change in one 
variable, almost always a price or money variable, and how it causes a percentage change in another variable, typically 
a quantity variable of some kind.

THAT WILL BE HOW MUCH?

How did the 60% price increase in 2011 end up for Netflix? It has been a very bumpy ride.
Before the price increase, there were about 24.6 million U.S. subscribers. After the price increase, 810,000 infuriated 
U.S. consumers canceled their Netflix subscriptions, dropping the total number of subscribers to 23.79 million. Fast 
forward to June 2013, when there were 36 million streaming Netflix subscribers in the United States. This was an 
increase of 11.4 million subscribers since the price increase—an average per quarter growth of about 1.6 million. This 
growth is less than the 2 million per quarter increases Netflix experienced in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first 
quarter of 2011.
During the first year after the price increase, the firm’s stock price (a measure of future expectations for the firm) 
fell from

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   195
about $300 per share to just under $54. In 2015, however, the stock price is at $448 per share. Today, Netflix has 57 
million subscribers in fifty countries.
What happened? Obviously, Netflix company officials understood the law of demand. Company officials reported, when 
announcing the price increase, this could result in the loss of about 600,000 existing subscribers. Using the 
elasticity of demand formula, it is easy to see company officials expected an inelastic response:









In addition, Netflix officials had anticipated the price increase would have little impact on attracting new customers. 
Net- flix anticipated adding up to 1.29 million new subscribers in the third quarter of 2011. It is true this was 
slower growth than the firm had experienced—about 2 million per quarter.
Why was the estimate of customers leaving so far off? In the 18 years since Netflix had been founded, there was an 
increase in the number of close, but not perfect, substitutes. Consumers now had choices ranging from Vudu, Amazon 
Prime, Hulu, and Redbox, to retail stores. Jaime Weinman reported in Maclean’s that Redbox kiosks are “a five-minute 
drive for less from 68 percent of Americans, and it seems that many people still find a five-minute drive more 
convenient than loading up a movie online.” It seems that in 2012, many consumers still preferred a physical DVD disk 
over streaming video.
What missteps did the Netflix management make? In addition to misjudging the elasticity of demand, by failing to 
account for  close  substitutes,  it  seems  they  may  have  also  misjudged  customers’  preferences  and  tastes.  
Yet,  as  the  population increases, the preference for streaming video may overtake physical DVD disks. Netflix, the 
source of numerous late night talk show laughs and jabs in 2011, may yet have the last laugh.


KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

Elasticity  is  a  general  term,  referring  to  percentage  change  of  one  variable  divided  by  percentage change 
 of  a  related  variable  that  can  be  applied  to  many  economic  connections.  For  instance,  the income 
elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change  in  income.  The  
cross-price  elasticity  of  demand  is  the  percentage  change  in  the  quantity demanded of a good divided by the 
percentage change in the price of another good. Elasticity applies in labor markets and financial capital markets just 
as it does in markets for goods and services. The wage elasticity of labor supply is the percentage change in the 
quantity of hours supplied divided by the percentage change in the wage. The elasticity of savings with respect to 
interest rates is the per- centage change in the quantity of savings divided by the percentage change in interest 
rates.

SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS



1.    What would the gasoline price elasticity of supply mean to UPS or FedEx?
2.    The average annual income rises from $25,000 to $38,000, and the quantity of bread consumed in a year by the 
average person falls from 30 loaves to 22 loaves. What is the income elasticity of bread consumption? Is bread a normal 
or an inferior good?

CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS



1.    Normal goods are defined as having a positive income elasticity. We can divide normal goods into two types: Those 
whose income elasticity is less than one and those whose income elasticity is greater than one. Think about products 
that would fall into each category. Can you come up with a name for each category?
2.    Suppose you could buy shoes one at a time, rather than in pairs. What do you predict the cross-price elasticity 
for left shoes and right shoes would be?
