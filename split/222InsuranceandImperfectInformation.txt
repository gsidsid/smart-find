nsurance is a method that households and firms use to prevent any single event from having a significant detrimental 
financial effect. Generally, households or firms with insurance make regu- lar  payments,  called  premiums.  The  
insurance  company  prices  these  premiums  based  on  the
probability of certain events occurring among a pool of people. Members of the group who then suf- fer a specified bad 
experience receive payments from this pool of money.

Many people have several kinds of insurance: health insurance that pays when they receive medical care; car insurance 
that pays if they are the driver in an automobile accident; house or renter’s insur- ance that pays if possessions are 
stolen or damaged by fire; and life insurance, which pays for the fam- ily if the principal dies. Table 1 lists a set 
of insurance markets.

Table 1. Some Insurance Markets

All insurance involves imperfect information in both an obvious way and in a deeper way. At an obvi- ous level, future 
events cannot be predicted with certainty. For example, it cannot be known with certainty  who  will  have  a  car  
accident,  become  ill,  die,  or  have  his  home  robbed  in  the  next  year. Imperfect information also applies to 
estimating the risk that something will happen to any individ-

ual. It is difficult for an insurance company to estimate the risk that, say, a particular 20-year-old male driver from 
New York City will have an accident, because even within that group, some drivers will drive more safely than others. 
Thus, adverse events occur out of a combination of people’s character- istics and choices that make the risks higher or 
lower and then the good or bad luck of what actually happens.

HOW INSURANCE WORKS

A simplified example of automobile insurance might work this way. Suppose that a group of 100 dri- vers can be divided 
into three groups. In a given year, 60 of those people have only a few door dings or chipped paint, which costs $100 
each. Another 30 of the drivers have medium-sized accidents that cost an average of $1,000 in damages, and 10 of the 
drivers have large accidents that cost $15,000 in damages. For the moment, let’s imagine that at the beginning of any 
year, there is no way of identify- ing the drivers who are low-risk, medium-risk, or high-risk. The total damage 
incurred by car acci- dents in this group of 100 drivers will be $186,000, that is:






If each of the 100 drivers pays a premium of $1,860 each year, the insurance company will collect the
$186,000 that is needed to cover the costs of the accidents that occur.

Since  insurance  companies  have  such  a  large  number  of  clients,  they  are  able  to  negotiate  with providers 
of health care and other services for lower rates than the individual would be able to get, thus increasing the benefit 
to consumers of becoming insured and saving the insurance company itself money when it pays out claims.

Insurance companies receive income, as shown in Figure 1, from insurance premiums and investment income. Investment 
income is derived from investing the funds that insurance companies received in the past but did not pay out as 
insurance claims in prior years. The insurance company receives a rate of return from investing these funds or 
reserves. The investments are typically made in fairly safe, liquid (easy to convert into cash) investments, as the 
insurance companies needs to be able to readily access these funds when a major disaster strikes.

GOVERNMENT AND SOCIAL INSURANCE

Federal  and  state  governments  run  a  number  of  insurance  programs.  Some  of  the  programs  look much like 
private insurance, in the sense that the members of a group makes steady payments into a fund, and those in the group 
who suffer an adverse experience receive payments. Other programs protect against risk, but without an explicit fund 
being set up. Following are some examples.

•   Unemployment insurance: Employers in every state pay a small amount for unemployment insurance, which goes into a 
fund that is used to pay benefits to workers for a period of time, usually six months, after they lose their jobs.
•   Pension insurance: Employers that offer pensions to their retired employees are required by law to pay a small 
fraction of what they are setting aside for pensions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, which is used to pay 
at least some pension benefits to workers if a company goes bankrupt and cannot pay the pensions it has promised.
•   Deposit insurance: Banks are required by law to pay a small fraction of their deposits to the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation, which goes into a fund that is used to pay depositors the value of their bank deposits up to 
$250,000 (the amount was raised from
$100,000 to $250,000 in 2008) if the bank should go bankrupt.
•   Workman’s compensation insurance: Employers are required by law to pay a small percentage of the salaries that they 
pay into funds, typically run at the state level, that are used to pay benefits to workers who suffer an injury on the 
job.
•   Retirement insurance: All workers pay a percentage of their income into Social Security and into Medicare, which 
then provides income and health care benefits to the elderly. Social Security and Medicare are not literally 
“insurance” in the sense that those currently contributing to the fund are not eligible for benefits. They function 
like insurance, however, in the sense that regular payments are made into the programs today in exchange for benefits 
to be received in the case of a later event—either becoming old or becoming sick when old. Such programs are sometimes 
called “social insurance.”

The major additional costs to insurance companies, other than the payment of claims, are the costs of running a 
business: the administrative costs of hiring workers, administering accounts, and pro- cessing  insurance  claims.  For 
 most  insurance  companies,  the  insurance  premiums  coming  in  and the claims payments going out are much larger 
than the amounts earned by investing money or the administrative costs.

Thus, while factors like investment income earned on reserves, administrative costs, and groups with different risks 
complicate the overall picture, a fundamental law of insurance must hold true: The average person’s payments into 
insurance over time must cover 1) the average person’s claims, 2) the costs of running the company, and 3) leave room 
for the firm’s profits. This law can be boiled down to the idea that average premiums and average insurance payouts 
must be approximately equal.

RISK GROUPS AND ACTUARIAL FAIRNESS

Not all of those who purchase insurance face the same risks. Some people may be more likely, because of genetics or 
personal habits, to fall sick with certain diseases. Some people may live in an area where car theft or home robbery is 
more likely than others. Some drivers are safer than others. A risk group can be defined as a group that shares roughly 
the same risks of an adverse event occurring.

Insurance companies often classify people into risk groups, and charge lower premiums to those with lower risks. If 
people are not separated into risk groups, then those with low-risk must pay for those with high risks. In the simple 
example of how car insurance works, given earlier, 60 drivers had very low damage of $100 each, 30 drivers had 
medium-sized accidents that cost $1,000 each, and 10 of the drivers had large accidents that cost $15,000. If all 100 
of these drivers pay the same $1,860, then those with low damages are in effect paying for those with high damages.

If it is possible to classify drivers according to risk group, then each group can be charged according to its expected 
losses. For example, the insurance company might charge the 60 drivers who seem safest of all $100 apiece, which is the 
average value of the damages they cause. Then the intermediate group could pay $1,000 apiece and the high-cost group 
$15,000 each. When the level of insurance premiums that someone pays is equal to the amount that an average person in 
that risk group would collect in insurance payments, the level of insurance is said to be “actuarially fair.”

Classifying people into risk groups can be controversial. For example, if someone had a major auto- mobile accident 
last year, should that person be classified as a high-risk driver who is likely to have similar accidents in the 
future, or as a low-risk driver who was just extremely unlucky? The driver is likely to claim to be low-risk, and thus 
someone who should be in a risk group with those who pay low insurance premiums in the future. The insurance company is 
likely to believe that, on average, having a major accident is a signal of being a high-risk driver, and thus try to 
charge this driver higher insurance premiums. The next two sections discuss the two major problems of imperfect 
information in insurance markets—called moral hazard and adverse selection. Both problems arise from attempts to 
categorize those purchasing insurance into risk groups.

THE MORAL HAZARD PROBLEM
Moral ftazard refers to the case when people engage in riskier behavior with insurance than they would if they did not 
have insurance. For example, if you have health insurance that covers the cost of visiting the doctor, you may be less 
likely to take precautions against catching an illness that might require a doctor’s visit. If you have car insurance, 
you will worry less about driving or parking your car in ways that make it more likely to get dented. In another 
example, a business without insurance might install absolute top-level security and fire sprinkler systems to guard 
against theft and fire. If it is insured, that same business might only install a minimum level of security and fire 
sprinkler sys- tems.

Moral hazard cannot be eliminated, but insurance companies have some ways of reducing its effect. Investigations to 
prevent insurance fraud are one way of reducing the extreme cases of moral hazard. Insurance companies can also monitor 
certain kinds of behavior; to return to the example from above, they might offer a business a lower rate on property 
insurance if the business installs a top-level secu- rity and fire sprinkler system and has those systems inspected 
once a year.

Another method to reduce moral hazard is to require the injured party to pay a share of the costs. For example, 
insurance policies often have deductibles, which is an amount that the insurance pol- icyholder must pay out of their 
own pocket before the insurance coverage starts paying. For exam- ple, auto insurance might pay for all losses greater 
than $500. Health insurance policies often have a copayment, in which the policyholder must pay a small amount; for 
example, a person might have to pay $20 for each doctor visit, and the insurance company would cover the rest. Another 
method of cost-sharing is coinsurance, which means that the insurance company covers a certain percentage of

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   631

the cost. For example, insurance might pay for 80% of the costs of repairing a home after a fire, but the homeowner 
would pay the other 20%.

All of these forms of cost-sharing discourage moral hazard, because people know that they will have to pay something 
out of their own pocket when they make an insurance claim. The effect can be pow- erful. One prominent study found that 
when people face moderate deductibles and copayments for their health insurance, they consume about one-third less in 
medical care than people who have com- plete insurance and do not pay anything out of pocket, presumably because 
deductibles and copay- ments reduce the level of moral hazard. However, those who consumed less health care did not 
seem to have any difference in health status.

A final way of reducing moral hazard, which is especially applicable to health care, is to focus on the incentives of 
providers of health care, rather than consumers. Traditionally, most health care in the United States has been provided 
on a fee-for-service basis, which means that medical care providers are paid for the services they provide and are paid 
more if they provide additional services. However, in the last decade or so, the structure of healthcare provision has 
shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations (HMOs). A ftealtft maintenance organization (HMO) provides 
health- care that receives a fixed amount per person enrolled in the plan—regardless of how many services are provided. 
In this case, a patient with insurance has an incentive to demand more care, but the health- care provider, which is 
receiving only a fixed payment, has an incentive to reduce the moral hazard problem by limiting the quantity of care 
provided—as long as it will not lead to worse health prob- lems and higher costs later. Today, many doctors are paid 
with some combination of managed care and fee-for-service; that is, a flat amount per patient, but with additional 
payments for the treatment of certain health conditions.

Imperfect information is the cause of the moral hazard problem. If an insurance company had perfect information on 
risk, it could simply raise its premiums every time an insured party engages in riskier behavior. However, an insurance 
company cannot monitor all the risks that people take all the time and so, even with various checks and cost-sharing, 
moral hazard will remain a problem.

THE ADVERSE SELECTION PROBLEM
Adverse selection refers to the problem in which the buyers of insurance  have more information about whether they are 
high-risk or low-risk than the insurance company does. This creates an asym- metric information problem for the 
insurance company because buyers who are high-risk tend to want to buy more insurance, without letting the insurance 
company know about their higher risk. For

632                   ERIK  DEAN, JUSTIN  ELARDO, MITCH  GREEN, BENJAMIN  WILSON, SEBASTIAN  BERGER 


example, someone purchasing health insurance or life insurance probably knows more about their family’s health history 
than an insurer can reasonably find out even with a costly investigation; some- one purchasing car insurance may know 
that they are a high-risk driver who has not yet had a major accident—but it is hard for the insurance company to 
collect information about how people actually drive.

To understand how adverse selection can strangle an insurance market, recall the situation of 100 dri- vers who are 
buying automobile insurance, where 60 drivers had very low damages of $100 each, 30 drivers had medium-sized accidents 
that cost $1,000 each, and 10 of the drivers had large accidents that cost $15,000. That would equal $186,000 in total 
payouts by the insurance company. Imagine that, while the insurance company knows the overall size of the losses, it 
cannot identify the high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk drivers. However, the drivers themselves know their risk 
groups. Since there is asymmetric information between the insurance company and the drivers, the insurance com- pany 
would likely set the price of insurance at $1,860 per year, to cover the average loss (not including the cost of 
overhead and profit). The result is that those with low risks of only $100 will likely decide not to buy insurance; 
after all, it makes no sense for them to pay $1,860 per year when they are likely only to experience losses of $100. 
Those with medium risks of a $1,000 accident will not buy insur- ance either. So the insurance company ends up only 
selling insurance for $1,860 to high-risk drivers who will average $15,000 in claims apiece. So the insurance company 
ends up losing a lot of money. If the insurance company tries to raise its premiums to cover the losses of those with 
high risks, then those with low or medium risks will be even more discouraged from buying insurance.

Rather than face such a situation of adverse selection, the insurance company may decide not to sell insurance in this 
market at all. If an insurance market is to exist, then one of two things must happen. First, the insurance company 
might find some way of separating insurance buyers into risk groups with some degree of accuracy and charging them 
accordingly, which in practice often means that the insurance company tries not to sell insurance to those who may pose 
high risks. Or second, those with low risks must be required to buy insurance, even if they have to pay more than the 
actuarially fair amount for their risk group. The notion that people can be required to purchase insurance raises the 
issue of government laws and regulations that influence the insurance industry.

U.S. HEALTH CARE IN AN INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT

The United States is the only high-income country in the world where most health insurance is paid for and provided by 
private firms. Greater government involvement in the provision of health insur- ance is one possible way of addressing 
moral hazard and adverse selection problems.

The  moral  hazard  problem  with  health  insurance  is  that  when  people  have  insurance,  they  will demand 
higher quantities of health care. In the United States, private healthcare insurance tends to encourage an ever-greater 
demand for healthcare services, which healthcare providers are happy to fulfill. Table 2 shows that on a per-person 
basis, U.S. healthcare spending towers above other coun- tries. It should be noted that while healthcare expenditures 
in the United States are far higher than healthcare expenditures in other countries, the health outcomes in the United 
States, as measured by life expectancy and lower rates of childhood mortality, tend to be lower. Health outcomes, 
however, may not be significantly affected by healthcare expenditures. Many studies have shown that a coun- try’s 
health is more closely related to diet, exercise, and genetic factors than to healthcare expenditure. This fact further 
emphasizes that the United States is spending very large amounts on medical care with little obvious health gain.

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   633
In the U.S. health insurance market, the main way of solving this adverse selection problem is that health insurance is 
often sold through groups based on place of employment, or, under The Afford- able Care Act, from a state government 
sponsored health exchange market. From an insurance com- pany’s point of view, selling insurance through an employer 
mixes together a group of people—some with high risks of future health problems and some with lower risks—and thus 
reduces the insur- ance  firm’s fear of attracting  only those who have high risks.  However, many small  companies do 
not provide health insurance to their employees, and many lower-paying jobs do not include health insurance. Even after 
all U.S. government programs that provide health insurance for the elderly and the poor are taken into account, 
approximately 32 million Americans were without health insurance in 2015. While a government-controlled system can 
avoid the adverse selection problem entirely by providing at least basic health insurance for all, another option is to 
mandate that all Americans buy health insurance from some provider by preventing providers from denying individuals 
based on pre- existing conditions. Indeed, this approach was adopted in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 
which is discussed later on in this chapter.

At its best, the largely private U.S. system of health insurance and healthcare delivery provides an extraordinarily 
high quality of care, along with generating a seemingly endless parade of life-saving innovations. But the system also 
struggles to control its high costs and to provide basic medical care to all. Other countries have lower costs and more 
equal access, but they often struggle to provide rapid access to health care and to offer the near-miracles of the most 
up-to-date medical care. The challenge is a healthcare system that strikes the right balance between quality, access, 
and cost.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF INSURANCE

The U.S. insurance industry is primarily regulated at the state level; indeed, since 1871 there has been a National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners that brings together these state regulators to exchange information and 
strategies. The state insurance regulators typically attempt to accomplish two things: to keep the price of insurance 
low and to make sure that everyone has insurance. These goals, however, can conflict with each other and also become 
easily entangled in politics.

If insurance premiums are set at actuarially fair levels, so that people end up paying an amount that accurately 
reflects  their risk group, certain people will end up paying a lot. For example, if health insurance companies were 
trying to cover people who already have a chronic disease like AIDS, or who were elderly, they would charge these 
groups very high premiums for health insurance, because their expected health care costs are quite high. Women in the 
age bracket 18–44 consume, on aver-

634                   ERIK  DEAN, JUSTIN  ELARDO, MITCH  GREEN, BENJAMIN  WILSON, SEBASTIAN  BERGER 


age, about 65% more in health care spending than men. Young male drivers have more car accidents than young female 
drivers. Thus, actuarially fair insurance would tend to charge young men much more for car insurance than young women. 
Because people in high-risk groups would find themselves charged so heavily for insurance, they might choose not to buy 
insurance at all.

State insurance regulators have sometimes reacted by passing rules that attempt to set low premiums for insurance. Over 
time, however, the fundamental law of insurance must hold: the average amount received by individuals must equal the 
average amount paid in premiums. When rules are passed to keep premiums low, insurance companies try to avoid insuring 
any high-risk or even medium-risk parties. If a state legislature passes strict rules requiring insurance companies to 
sell to everyone at low prices, the insurance companies always have the option of withdrawing from doing business in 
that state. For example, the insurance regulators in New Jersey are well-known for attempting to keep auto insurance 
premiums low, and more than 20 different insurance companies stopped doing busi- ness in the state in the late 1990s 
and early 2000s. Similarly, in 2009, State Farm announced that it was withdrawing from selling property insurance in 
Florida.

In short, government regulators cannot force companies to charge low prices and provide high levels of insurance 
coverage—and thus take losses—for a sustained period of time. If insurance premiums are going to be set below the 
actuarially fair level for a certain group, some other group will have to make up the difference. There are two other 
groups who can make up the difference: taxpayers or other buyers of insurance.

In some industries, the U.S. government has decided free markets will not provide insurance at an affordable price, and 
so the government pays for it directly. For example, private health insurance is too expensive for many people whose 
incomes are too low. To combat this, the U.S. government, together with the states, runs the Medicaid program, which 
provides health care to those with low incomes. Private health insurance also does not work well for the elderly, 
because their average health care costs can be very high. Thus, the U.S. government started the Medicare program, which 
provides health insurance to all those over age 65. Other government-funded health-care programs are aimed at military 
veterans, as an added benefit, and children in families with relatively low incomes.

Another common government intervention in insurance markets is to require that everyone buy cer- tain kinds of 
insurance. For example, most states legally require car owners to buy auto insurance. Likewise, when a bank loans 
someone money to buy a home, the person is typically required to have homeowner’s insurance, which protects against 
fire and other physical damage (like hailstorms) to the home. A legal requirement that everyone must buy insurance 
means that insurance companies do not need to worry that those with low risks will avoid buying insurance. Since 
insurance companies do not need to fear adverse selection, they can set their prices based on an average for the 
market, and those with lower risks will, to some extent, end up subsidizing those with higher risks. However, even when 
laws are passed requiring people to purchase insurance, insurance companies cannot be com- pelled to sell insurance to 
everyone who asks—at least not at low cost. Thus, insurance companies will still try to avoid selling insurance to 
those with high risks whenever possible.

The government cannot pass laws that make the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection dis- appear, but the 
government can make political decisions that certain groups should have insurance, even though the private market would 
not otherwise provide that insurance. Also, the government can impose the costs of that decision on taxpayers or on 
other buyers of insurance.

THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
In March of 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). This highly 
contentious law began to be phased in over time starting in October of 2013. The goal of the act is to bring the United 
States closer to universal coverage. Some of the key features of the plan include:

•   Individual mandate: All individuals, who do not receive health care through their employer or through a government 
program (for example, Medicare), are required to have health insurance or pay a fine. The individual mandate’s goal was 
to reduce the adverse selection problem and keep prices down by requiring all consumers—even the healthiest ones—to 
have health insurance. Without the need to guard against adverse selection (whereby only the riskiest consumers buy 
insurance) by raising prices, health insurance companies could provide more reasonable plans to their customers.
•   Each state is required to have health insurance exchanges whereby insurance companies compete for business. The 
goal of the exchanges is to improve competition in the market for health insurance.
•   Employer mandate: All employers with more than 50 employees must offer health insurance to their employees.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) will be funded through additional taxes to include:

•   Increase the Medicare tax by 0.9 percent and add a 3.8 percent tax on unearned income for high income taxpayers.
•   Charge an annual fee on health insurance providers.
•   Impose other taxes such as a 2.3% tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices.

Many people and politicians have sought to overturn the bill. Those that oppose the bill believe it vio- lates an 
individual’s right to choose whether to have insurance or not. In 2012, a number of states challenged the law on the 
basis that the individual mandate provision is unconstitutional. In June of 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 5–4 
decision that the individual mandate is actually a tax, so it is constitutional as the federal government has the right 
to tax the populace.


WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL WITH OBAMACARE?

What is it that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will actually do? To begin with, we should note that it is a massively 
complex law, with a large number of parts, some of which were implemented immediately, and others that will start every 
year from 2013 through 2020.
As noted in the chapter, people face ever-increasing healthcare costs in the United States. Those with health insurance 
demand more health care, pushing up the cost. This is one of the problems the ACA is attempting to fix, in part by 
intro- ducing regulations designed to control increases in healthcare costs. One example is the regulation that caps 
the amount healthcare providers can spend on administrative costs. Another is a requirement that healthcare providers 
switch to elec- tronic medical records (EMRs), which will reduce administrative costs.
Another component of the ACA is the requirement that states establish health insurance exchanges, or markets, where 
peo- ple without health insurance, and businesses that do not provide it for their employees, can shop for different 
insurance

plans. Setting up these exchanges reduces the imperfections in the market for insurance and, by adding to the supply of 
insurance plans, may lead to lower prices if the supply increases more than demand. Also, people who are uninsured tend 
to use emergency rooms for treatment—the most expensive form of healthcare. Given that there are over 40 million unin- 
sured citizens in the United States, this has contributed significantly to rising costs. Capping administrative costs, 
requiring the use of EMRs, and establishing health insurance markets for those currently uninsured, are all components 
of the ACA that are intended to help control increases in healthcare costs.
Over the years, the ranks of the uninsured in the United States have grown as rising prices, designed to offset the 
problem of distinguishing the high-risk from the low-risk person, have pushed employers and individuals out of the 
market. Also, insurance companies have increasingly used pre-existing conditions to determine if someone is high risk, 
and thus they either charge prices based on average costs, or they choose not to insure these groups. This has also 
contributed to the over 32 million uninsured. The ACA addresses this problem by providing that people with preexisting 
conditions cannot be denied health insurance.
This presents another selection problem because those with pre-existing conditions are a high-risk group. Taken as a 
sep- arate group, the law of insurance says they should pay higher prices for insurance. Since they cannot be singled 
out, prices go up for everyone, and low-risk people leave the group. As the high-risk group gets sicker and more risky, 
prices go up again, and still more people leave the group, creating an upward spiral in prices. To offset this 
selection problem, the ACA includes an employer and individual mandate requirement. All businesses and individuals must 
purchase health insurance. At the time of this writing, the actual impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act is still unknown. Due to political opposition and some difficulties with meeting deadlines, several parts of the 
law have been delayed, and it will be some time before economists are able to collect enough data to determine whether 
the law has, in fact, increased coverage and lowered costs as was its intent.


KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

Insurance  is  a  way  of  sharing  risk.  A  group  of  people  pay  premiums  for  insurance  against  some 
unpleasant event, and those in the group who actually experience the unpleasant event then receive some compensation. 
The fundamental law of insurance is that what the average person pays in over time must be very similar to what the 
average person gets out. In an actuarially fair insurance policy, the premiums that a person pays to the insurance 
company are the same as the average amount of benefits for a person in that risk group. Moral hazard arises in 
insurance markets because those who are insured against a risk will have less reason to take steps to avoid the costs 
from that risk.

Many insurance policies have deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance. A deductible is the maximum amount that the 
policyholder must pay out-of-pocket before the insurance company pays the rest of the bill. A copayment is a flat fee 
that an insurance policy-holder must pay before receiving services. Coinsurance requires the policyholder to pay a 
certain percentage of costs. Deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance reduce moral hazard by requiring the insured 
party to bear some of the costs before collecting insurance benefits.

In a fee-for-service health financing system, medical care providers are reimbursed according to the cost of services 
they provide. An alternative method of organizing health care is through health main- tenance organizations (HMOs), 
where medical care providers are reimbursed according to the num- ber of patients they handle, and it is up to the 
providers to allocate resources between patients who receive more or fewer health care services. Adverse selection 
arises in insurance markets when insur- ance buyers know more about the risks they face than does the insurance 
company. As a result, the

insurance company runs the risk that low-risk parties will avoid its insurance because it is too costly for them, while 
high-risk parties will embrace it because it looks like a good deal to them.

CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS



1.    How do you think the problem of moral hazard might have affected the safety of sports such as football and boxing 
when safety regulations started requiring that players wear more padding?
2.    To what sorts of customers would an insurance company offer a policy with a high copay? What about a high premium 
with a lower copay?



PROBLEMS



Imagine that 50-year-old men can be divided into two groups: those who have a family history of cancer and those who do 
not. For the purposes of this example, say that 20% of a group of 1,000 men have a family history of cancer, and these 
men have one chance in 50 of dying in the next year, while the other 80% of men have one chance in 200 of dying in the 
next year. The insurance company is selling a policy that will pay $100,000 to the estate of anyone who dies in the 
next year.

a.    If the insurance company were selling life insurance separately to each group, what would be the actuarially fair 
premium for each group?

b.    If an insurance company were offering life insurance to the entire group, but could not find out about family 
cancer histories, what would be the actuarially fair premium for the group as a whole?
c.    What will happen to the insurance company if it tries to charge the actuarially fair premium to the group as a 
whole rather than to each group separately?

Answers to Self-Cfteck Questions
It is almost impossible to distinguish whether a health outcome such as life expectancy was the result of personal 
pref- erences that might affect health and longevity, such as diet, exercise, certain risky behavior, and consumption 
of certain items like tobacco, or the result of expenditures on health care (for example, annual check-ups).
