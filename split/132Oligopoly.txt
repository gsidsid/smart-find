LEARNING OBJECTIVES


By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•    Explain why and how oligopolies exist

•    Contrast collusion and competition

•    Interpret and analyze the prisoner’s dilemma diagram

•    Evaluate the tradeoffs of imperfect competition



any purchases that individuals make at the retail level are produced in markets that are nei- ther perfectly 
competitive, monopolies, nor monopolistically competitive. Rather, they are oligopolies. Oligopoly arises when a small 
number of large firms have all or most of the
sales in an industry. Examples of oligopoly abound and include the auto industry, cable television, and commercial air 
travel. Oligopolistic firms are like cats in a bag. They can either scratch each other to pieces or cuddle up and get 
comfortable with one another. If oligopolists compete hard, they may end up acting very much like perfect competitors, 
driving down costs and leading to zero profits for all. If oligopolists collude with each other, they may effectively 
act like a monopoly and succeed in pushing up  prices  and  earning  consistently  high  levels  of  profit.  
Oligopolies  are  typically  characterized  by mutual interdependence where various decisions such as output, price, 
advertising, and so on, depend on the decisions of the other firm(s). Analyzing the choices of oligopolistic firms 
about pricing and quantity produced involves considering the pros and cons of competition versus collusion at a given 
point in time.

WHY DO OLIGOPOLIES EXIST?

A combination of the barriers to entry that create monopolies and the product differentiation that characterizes 
monopolistic competition can create the setting for an oligopoly. For example, when a government grants a patent for an 
invention to one firm, it may create a monopoly. When the govern- ment grants patents to, for example, three different 
pharmaceutical companies that each has its own drug for reducing high blood pressure, those three firms may become an 
oligopoly.
Similarly,  a  natural  monopoly  will  arise  when  the  quantity  demanded  in  a  market  is  only  large enough for 
a single firm to operate at the minimum of the long-run average cost curve. In such a set- ting, the market has room 
for only one firm, because no smaller firm can operate at a low enough average cost to compete, and no larger firm 
could sell what it produced given the quantity demanded in the market.

380                   ERIK  DEAN, JUSTIN  ELARDO, MITCH  GREEN, BENJAMIN  WILSON, SEBASTIAN  BERGER 

Quantity demanded in the market may also be two or three times the quantity needed to produce at the minimum of the 
average cost curve—which means that the market would have room for only two or three oligopoly firms (and they need not 
produce differentiated products). Again, smaller firms would have higher average costs and be unable to compete, while 
additional large firms would pro- duce such a high quantity that they would not be able to sell it at a profitable 
price. This combination of economies of scale and market demand creates the barrier to entry, which led to the 
Boeing-Airbus oligopoly for large passenger aircraft.

The product differentiation at the heart of monopolistic competition can also play a role in creating oligopoly. For 
example, firms may need to reach a certain minimum size before they are able to spend enough on advertising and 
marketing to create a recognizable brand name. The problem in compet- ing with, say, Coca-Cola or Pepsi is not that 
producing fizzy drinks is technologically difficult, but rather that creating a brand name and marketing effort to 
equal Coke or Pepsi is an enormous task.

COLLUSION OR COMPETITION?

When oligopoly firms in a certain market decide what quantity to produce and what price to charge, they face a 
temptation to act as if they were a monopoly. By acting together, oligopolistic firms can hold down industry output, 
charge a higher price, and divide up the profit among themselves. When firms act together in this way to reduce output 
and keep prices high, it is called collusion. A group of firms that have a formal agreement to collude to produce the 
monopoly output and sell at the monop- oly price is called a cartel. See the following Clear It Up feature for a more 
in-depth analysis of the difference between the two.


COLLUSION VERSUS CARTELS: HOW CAN I TELL WHICH IS WHICH?

In the United States, as well as many other countries, it is illegal for firms to collude since collusion is 
anti-competitive behavior, which is a violation of antitrust law. Both the Antitrust Division of tfte Justice 
Department and the Federal Trade Commission have responsibilities for preventing collusion in the United States.
The problem of enforcement is finding hard evidence of collusion. Cartels are formal agreements to collude. Because 
cartel agreements provide evidence of collusion, they are rare in the United States. Instead, most collusion is tacit, 
where firms implicitly reach an understanding that competition is bad for profits.

The desire of businesses to avoid competing so that they can instead raise the prices that they charge and  earn  
higher  profits  has  been  well  understood  by  economists.  Adam Smitft  wrote  in  Wealth  of Nations in 1776: 
“People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a 
conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.”

Even when oligopolists recognize that they would benefit as a group by acting like a monopoly, each individual  
oligopoly faces a private temptation to produce just a slightly higher quantity  and earn slightly higher profit—while 
still counting on the other oligopolists to hold down their production and keep prices high. If at least some 
oligopolists give in to this temptation and start producing more, then the market price will fall. Indeed, a small 
handful of oligopoly firms may end up competing so fiercely that they all end up earning zero economic profits—as if 
they were perfect competitors.

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   381

THE PRISONER’S DILEMMA

Because of the complexity of oligopoly, which is the result of mutual interdependence among firms, there is no single, 
generally-accepted theory of how oligopolies behave, in the same way that we have theories for all the other market 
structures. Instead, economists use game tfteory, a branch of math- ematics that analyzes situations in which players 
must make decisions and then receive payoffs based on what other players decide to do. Game theory has found widespread 
applications in the social sci- ences, as well as in business, law, and military strategy.

The prisoner’s dilemma is a scenario in which the gains from cooperation are larger than the rewards from pursuing 
self-interest. It applies well to oligopoly. The story behind the prisoner’s dilemma goes like this:

Two co-conspiratorial criminals are arrested. When they are taken to the police station, they refuse to say anything 
and are put in separate interrogation rooms. Eventually, a police officer enters the room where Prisoner A is being 
held and says: “You know what? Your partner in the other room is confessing. So your partner is going to get a light 
prison sentence of just one year, and because you’re remaining silent, the judge is going to stick you with eight years 
in prison. Why don’t you get smart? If you confess, too, we’ll cut your jail time down to five years, and your partner 
will get five years, also.” Over in the next room, another police officer is giving exactly the same speech to Prisoner 
B. What the police officers do not say is that if both prisoners remain silent, the evidence against them is not 
especially strong, and the prisoners will end up with only two years in jail each.

The game theory situation facing the two prisoners is shown in Table 3. To understand the dilemma, first consider the 
choices from Prisoner A’s point of view. If A believes that B will confess, then A ought to confess, too, so as to not 
get stuck with the eight years in prison. But if A believes that B will not confess, then A will be tempted to act 
selfishly and confess, so as to serve only one year. The key point is that A has an incentive to confess regardless of 
what choice B makes! B faces the same set of choices, and thus will have an incentive to confess regardless of what 
choice A makes. Confess is considered the dominant strategy or the strategy an individual (or firm) will pursue 
regardless of the other individual’s (or firm’s) decision. The result is that if prisoners pursue their own 
self-interest, both are likely to confess, and end up doing a total of 10 years of jail time between them.


Prisoner B
Remain Silent (cooperate with other prisoner)


Confess (do not cooperate with other prisoner)



Prisoner
Remain Silent (cooperate with other prisoner)

A gets 2 years, B gets 2 years                  A gets 8 years, B gets 1 year
A                  Confess (do not cooperate with
other prisoner)                                            A gets 1 year, B gets 8 years                   A gets 5 
years B gets 5 years
Table 3. The Prisoner’s Dilemma Problem

The game is called a dilemma because if the two prisoners had cooperated by both remaining silent, they would only have 
had to serve a total of four years of jail time between them. If the two prisoners can work out some way of cooperating 
so that neither one will confess, they will both be better off than if they each follow their own individual 
self-interest, which in this case leads straight into longer jail terms.

THE OLIGOPOLY VERSION OF THE PRISONER’S DILEMMA

The members of an oligopoly can face a prisoner’s dilemma, also. If each of the oligopolists cooperates in holding down 
output, then high monopoly profits are possible. Each oligopolist, however, must worry that while it is holding down 
output, other firms are taking advantage of the high price by rais- ing output and earning higher profits. Table 4 
shows the prisoner’s dilemma for a two-firm oligop- oly—known as a duopoly. If Firms A and B both agree to hold down 
output, they are acting together as  a  monopoly  and  will  each  earn  $1,000  in  profits.  However,  both  firms’  
dominant  strategy  is  to increase output, in which case each will earn $400 in profits.


Firm B
Hold Down Output (cooperate with other firm)


Increase Output (do not cooperate with other firm)



Firm
Hold Down Output (cooperate with other firm)

A gets $1,000, B gets $1,000                   A gets $200, B gets $1,500
A          Increase Output (do not cooperate
with other firm)                                             A gets $1,500, B gets $200                      A gets 
$400, B gets $400
Table 4. A Prisoner’s Dilemma for Oligopolists

Can the two firms trust each other? Consider the situation of Firm A:

•   If A thinks that B will cheat on their agreement and increase output, then A will increase output, too, because for 
A the profit of $400 when both firms increase output (the bottom right-hand choice in Table 4) is better than a profit 
of only $200 if A keeps output low and B raises output (the upper right-hand choice in the table).
•   If A thinks that B will cooperate by holding down output, then A may seize the opportunity to earn higher profits 
by raising output. After all, if B is going to hold down output, then A can earn $1,500 in profits by expanding output 
(the bottom left-hand choice in the table) compared with only $1,000 by holding down output as well (the upper 
left-hand choice in the table).

Thus, firm A will reason that it makes sense to expand output if B holds down output and that it also makes sense to 
expand output if B raises output. Again, B faces a parallel set of decisions.

The result of this prisoner’s dilemma is often that even though A and B could make the highest com- bined profits by 
cooperating in producing a lower level of output and acting like a monopolist, the two firms may well end up in a 
situation where they each increase output and earn only $400 each in profits. The following Clear It Up feature 
discusses one cartel scandal in particular.


WHAT IS THE LYSINE CARTEL?

Lysine, a $600 million-a-year industry, is an amino acid used by farmers as a feed additive to ensure the proper growth 
of swine and poultry. The primary U.S. producer of lysine is Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), but several other large 
Euro- pean and Japanese firms are also in this market. For a time in the first half of the 1990s, the world’s major 
lysine producers met together in hotel conference rooms and decided exactly how much each firm would sell and what it 
would charge. The
U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), however, had learned of the cartel and placed wire taps on a number of 
their phone calls and meetings.

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   383



From FBI surveillance tapes, following is a comment that Terry Wilson, president of the corn processing division at 
ADM, made to the other lysine producers at a 1994 meeting in Mona, Hawaii:
I wanna go back and I wanna say something very simple. If we’re going to trust each other, okay, and if I’m assured 
that I’m gonna get 67,000 tons by the year’s end, we’re gonna sell it at the prices we agreed to . . . The only thing 
we need to talk about there because we are gonna get manipulated by these [expletive] buyers—they can be smarter than 
us if we let them be smarter        They
[the customers] are not your friend. They are not my friend. And we gotta have ‘em, but they are not my friends. You 
are my friend. I wanna be closer to you than I am to any customer. Cause you can make us … money. … And all I wanna 
tell you again is  let’s—let’s put the prices on the board. Let’s all agree that’s what we’re gonna do and then walk 
out of here and do it.

The price of lysine doubled while the cartel was in effect. Confronted by the FBI tapes, Archer Daniels Midland pled 
guilty in 1996 and paid a fine of $100 million. A number of top executives, both at ADM and other firms, later paid 
fines of up to
$350,000 and were sentenced to 24–30 months in prison.
In another one of the FBI recordings, the president of Archer Daniels Midland told an executive from another competing 
firm that ADM had a slogan that, in his words, had “penetrated the whole company.” The company president stated the 
slogan this way: “Our competitors are our friends. Our customers are the enemy.” That slogan could stand as the motto 
of cartels everywhere.


HOW TO ENFORCE COOPERATION

How can parties who find themselves in a prisoner’s dilemma situation avoid the undesired outcome and cooperate with 
each other? The way out of a prisoner’s dilemma is to find a way to penalize those who do not cooperate.

Perhaps the easiest approach for colluding oligopolists, as you might imagine, would be to sign a con- tract with each 
other that they will hold output low and keep prices high. If a group of U.S. com- panies signed such a contract, 
however, it would be illegal. Certain international organizations, like the nations that are members of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), have signed international agreements to act like a monopoly, hold 
down output, and keep prices high so that all of the countries can make high profits from oil exports. Such agreements, 
however, because they fall in a gray area of international law, are not legally enforceable. If Nigeria, for example, 
decides to start cutting prices and selling more oil, Saudi Arabia cannot sue Nigeria in court and force it to stop.

Visit the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries website and learn more about its history and how it defines 
itself.












Because oligopolists cannot sign a legally enforceable contract to act like a monopoly, the firms may instead keep 
close tabs on what other firms are producing and charging. Alternatively, oligopolists

384                   ERIK  DEAN, JUSTIN  ELARDO, MITCH  GREEN, BENJAMIN  WILSON, SEBASTIAN  BERGER 


may choose to act in a way that generates pressure on each firm to stick to its agreed quantity of out- put.

One example of the pressure these firms can exert on one another is the kinked demand curve, in which competing 
oligopoly firms commit to match price cuts, but not price increases. This situation is shown in Figure 1. Say that an 
oligopoly airline has agreed with the rest of a cartel to provide a quan- tity of 10,000 seats on the New York to Los 
Angeles route, at a price of $500. This choice defines the kink in the firm’s perceived demand curve. The reason that 
the firm faces a kink in its demand curve is because of how the other oligopolists react to changes in the firm’s 
price. If the oligopoly decides to produce more and cut its price, the other members of the cartel will immediately 
match any price cuts—and therefore, a lower price brings very little increase in quantity sold.

If one firm cuts its price to $300, it will be able to sell only 11,000 seats. However, if the airline seeks to raise 
prices, the other oligopolists will not raise their prices, and so the firm that raised prices will lose a considerable 
share of sales. For example, if the firm raises its price to $550, its sales drop to 5,000 seats sold. Thus, if 
oligopolists always match price cuts by other firms in the cartel, but do not match price increases, then none of the 
oligopolists will have a strong incentive to change prices, since the potential gains are minimal. This strategy can 
work like a silent form of cooperation, in which the cartel successfully manages to hold down output, increase price, 
and share a monopoly level of profits even without any legally enforceable agreement.

Many  real-world  oligopolies,  prodded  by  economic  changes,  legal  and  political  pressures,  and  the egos of 
their top executives, go through episodes of cooperation and competition. If oligopolies could sustain cooperation with 
each other on output and pricing, they could earn profits as if they were a single monopoly. However, each firm in an 
oligopoly has an incentive to produce more and grab a big- ger share of the overall market; when firms start behaving 
in this way, the market outcome in terms of prices and quantity can be similar to that of a highly competitive market.

TRADEOFFS OF IMPERFECT COMPETITION

Monopolistic competition is probably the single most common market structure in the U.S. economy. It provides powerful 
incentives for innovation, as firms seek to earn profits in the short run, while entry  assures  that  firms  do  not  
earn  economic  profits  in  the  long  run.  However,  monopolistically competitive firms do not produce at the lowest 
point on their average cost curves. In addition, the endless  search  to  impress  consumers  through  product  
differentiation  may  lead  to  excessive  social expenses on advertising and marketing.

Oligopoly  is  probably  the  second  most  common  market  structure.  When  oligopolies  result  from patented 
innovations or from taking advantage of economies of scale to produce at low average cost, they  may  provide  
considerable  benefit  to  consumers.  Oligopolies  are  often  buffeted  by  significant barriers to entry, which 
enable the oligopolists to earn sustained profits over long periods of time. Oligopolists also do not typically produce 
at the minimum of their average cost curves. When they lack vibrant competition, they may lack incentives to provide 
innovative products and high-quality service.

The  task  of  public  policy  with  regard  to  competition  is  to  sort  through  these  multiple  realities, 
attempting to encourage behavior that is beneficial to the broader society and to discourage behavior

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   385





















Figure 1. A Kinked Demand Curve. Consider a member firm in an oligopoly  cartel  that  is  supposed  to  produce  a  
quantity  of  10,000 and  sell  at  a  price  of  $500.  The  other  members  of  the  cartel  can encourage this firm 
to honor its commitments by acting so that the firm  faces  a  kinked  demand  curve.  If  the  oligopolist  attempts  
to expand output and reduce price slightly, other firms also cut prices immediately—so if the firm expands output to 
11,000, the price per unit falls dramatically, to $300. On the other side, if the oligopoly attempts to raise its 
price, other firms will not do so, so if the firm raises its price to $550, its sales decline sharply to 5,000. Thus, 
the members of a cartel can discipline each other to stick to the pre- agreed levels of quantity and price through a 
strategy of matching all price cuts but not matching any price increases.

that only adds to the profits of a few large companies, with no corresponding benefit to consumers. Monopoly and 
Antitrust Policy discusses the delicate judgments that go into this task.


THE TEMPTATION TO DEFY THE LAW

Oligopolistic firms have been called “cats in a bag,” as this chapter mentioned. The French detergent makers chose to 
“cozy up” with each other. The result? An uneasy and tenuous relationship. When the Wall Street Journal reported on the 
matter, it wrote: “According to a statement a Henkel manager made to the [French anti-trust] commission, the detergent 
makers wanted ‘to limit the intensity of the competition between them and clean up the market.’ Nevertheless, by the 
early 1990s, a price war had broken out among them.” During the soap executives’ meetings, which sometimes lasted more 
than four hours, complex pricing structures were established. “One [soap] executive recalled ‘chaotic’ meetings as each 
side tried to work out how the other had bent the rules.” Like many cartels, the soap cartel disintegrated due to the 
very strong tempta- tion for each member to maximize its own individual profits.
How did this soap opera end? After an investigation,  French antitrust authorities  fined Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel, 
and Proctor & Gamble a total of €361 million ($484 million). A similar fate befell the icemakers. Bagged ice is a 
commodity, a perfect substitute, generally sold in 7- or 22-pound bags. No one cares what label is on the bag. By 
agreeing to carve up the

386                   ERIK  DEAN, JUSTIN  ELARDO, MITCH  GREEN, BENJAMIN  WILSON, SEBASTIAN  BERGER 



ice market, control broad geographic swaths of territory, and set prices, the icemakers moved from perfect competition 
to a monopoly model. After the agreements, each firm was the sole supplier of bagged ice to a region; there were 
profits in both the long run and the short run. According to the courts: “These companies illegally conspired to 
manipulate the mar- ketplace.” Fines totaled about $600,000—a steep fine considering a bag of ice sells for under $3 in 
most parts of the United States.
Even though it is illegal in many parts of the world for firms to set prices and carve up a market, the temptation to 
earn higher profits makes it extremely tempting to defy the law.


KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

An oligopoly is a situation where a few firms sell most or all of the goods in a market. Oligopolists earn their 
highest profits if they can band together as a cartel and act like a monopolist by reducing output and raising price. 
Since each member of the oligopoly can benefit individually from expanding output, such collusion often breaks 
down—especially since explicit collusion is illegal.

The prisoner’s dilemma is an example of game theory. It shows how, in certain situations, all sides can benefit from 
cooperative behavior rather than self-interested behavior. However, the challenge for the parties is to find ways to 
encourage cooperative behavior.

SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS



1.    Consider the curve shown in Figure 2, which shows the market demand, marginal cost, and marginal revenue curve 
for firms in an oligopolistic industry. In this example, we assume firms have zero fixed costs.


















Figure 2.

a.    Suppose the firms collude to form a cartel. What price will the cartel charge? What quantity will the cartel 
supply? How much profit will the cartel earn?
b.    Suppose now that the cartel breaks up and the oligopolistic firms compete as vigorously as

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   387




possible by cutting the price and increasing sales. What will the industry quantity and price be? What will the 
collective profits be of all firms in the industry?
c.    Compare the equilibrium price, quantity, and profit for the cartel and cutthroat competition outcomes.

2.    Sometimes oligopolies in the same industry are very different in size. Suppose we have a duopoly where one firm 
(Firm A) is large and the other firm (Firm B) is small, as shown in the prisoner’s dilemma box in Table  5.

Firm B colludes witft Firm A    Firm B cfteats by selling more output

Firm A colludes with Firm B                    A gets $1,000, B gets $100            A gets $800, B gets $200 Firm A 
cheats by selling more output    A gets $1,050, B gets $50              A gets $500, B gets $20 Table 5.
Assuming that the payoffs are known to both firms, what is the likely outcome in this case?




REVIEW QUESTIONS



1.    Will the firms in an oligopoly act more like a monopoly or more like competitors? Briefly explain.
2.    Does each individual in a prisoner’s dilemma benefit more from cooperation or from pursuing self-interest? 
Explain briefly.
3.    What stops oligopolists from acting together as a monopolist and earning the highest possible level of profits?



CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS



1.    Would you expect the kinked demand curve to be more extreme (like a right angle) or less extreme (like a normal 
demand curve) if each firm in the cartel produces a near-identical product like OPEC and petroleum? What if each firm 
produces a somewhat different product? Explain your reasoning.
2.    When OPEC raised the price of oil dramatically in the mid-1970s, experts said it was unlikely that the cartel 
could stay together over the long term—that the incentives for individual members to cheat would become too strong. 
More than forty years later, OPEC still exists. Why do you think OPEC has been able to beat the odds and continue to 
collude? Hint: You may wish to consider non-economic reasons.



PROBLEMS



1.    Mary and Raj are the only two growers who provide organically grown corn to a local grocery store. They know that 
if they cooperated and produced less corn, they could raise the price of the corn. If they work independently, they 
will each earn $100. If they decide to work together and both lower their output, they

388                   ERIK  DEAN, JUSTIN  ELARDO, MITCH  GREEN, BENJAMIN  WILSON, SEBASTIAN  BERGER 



can each earn $150. If one person lowers output and the other does not, the person who lowers output will earn $0 and 
the other person will capture the entire market and will earn $200. Table 6 represents the choices available to Mary 
and Raj. What is the best choice for Raj if he is sure that Mary will cooperate? If Mary thinks Raj will cheat, what 
should Mary do and why? What is the prisoner’s dilemma result? What is the preferred choice if they could ensure 
cooperation? A = Work independently; B = Cooperate and Lower Output. (Each results entry lists Raj’s earnings first, 
and Mary’s earnings second.)
2.    Jane and Bill are apprehended for a bank robbery. They are taken into separate rooms and questioned by the police 
about their involvement in the crime. The police tell them each that if they confess and turn the other person in, they 
will receive a lighter sentence. If they both confess, they will be each be sentenced to 30  years. If neither 
confesses, they will each receive a 20-year sentence. If only one confesses, the confessor will receive 15 years and 
the one who stayed silent will receive 35 years. Table 7 below represents the choices available to Jane and Bill. If 
Jane trusts Bill to stay silent, what should she do? If Jane thinks that Bill will confess, what should she do? Does 
Jane have a dominant strategy? Does Bill have a dominant strategy? A = Confess; B = Stay Silent. (Each results entry 
lists Jane’s sentence first (in years), and Bill’s sentence second.)

Jane

A               B


Bill

A    (30, 30)    (15, 35)

B    (35, 15)    (20, 20)

Answers to Self-Cfteck Questions

1.                a.    If the firms form a cartel, they will act like a monopoly, choosing the quantity of output 
where MR = MC. Drawing a line from the monopoly quantity up to the demand curve shows the monopoly price. Assuming that 
fixed costs are zero, and with an understanding of cost and profit, we can infer that when the marginal cost curve is 
horizontal, average cost is the same as marginal cost. Thus, the cartel will earn positive economic profits equal to 
the area of the rectangle, with a base equal to the monopoly quantity and a height equal to the difference between 
price (on the demand above the monopoly quantity) and average cost, as shown in the following figure.

b.    The firms will expand output and cut price as long as there are profits remaining. The long-run equilibrium will 
occur at the point where average cost equals demand. As a result, the oligopoly will earn zero economic profits due to 
“cutthroat competition,” as shown in the next figure.
c.    Pc > Pcc. Qc < Qcc. Profit for the cartel is positive and large. Profit for cutthroat competition is zero.

2.    Firm B reasons that if it cheats and Firm A does not notice, it will double its money. Since Firm A’s profits 
will decline substantially, however, it is likely that Firm A will notice and if so, Firm A will cheat also, with the 
result that Firm B will lose 90% of what it gained by cheating. Firm A will reason that Firm B is unlikely to risk 
cheating. If neither firm cheats, Firm A earns $1000. If Firm A cheats, assuming Firm B does not cheat, A can boost its 
profits only a little, since Firm B is so small. If both firms cheat, then Firm A loses at least 50% of what it could 
have earned. The possibility of a small gain ($50) is probably not enough to induce Firm A to cheat, so in this case it 
is likely that both firms will collude.
