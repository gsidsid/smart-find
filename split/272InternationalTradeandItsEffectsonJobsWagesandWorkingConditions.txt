n theory at least, imports might injure workers in several different ways: fewer jobs, lower wages, or poor working 
conditions. Let’s consider these in turn.

FEWER JOBS?
In the early 1990s, the United States was negotiating the Nortft American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico, an 
agreement that reduced tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers to trade between the United States, Mexico, and 
Canada. H. Ross Perot, a 1992 candidate for U.S. presi- dent, claimed, in prominent campaign arguments, that if the 
United States expanded trade with Mex- ico, there would be a “giant sucking sound” as U.S. employers relocated to 
Mexico to take advantage of lower wages. After all, average wages in Mexico were, at that time, about one-eighth of 
those in the United States. NAFTA passed Congress, President Bill Clinton signed it into law, and it took effect in 
1995. For the next six years, the United States economy had some of the most rapid job growth and low unemployment in 
its history. Those who feared that open trade with Mexico would lead to a dra- matic decrease in jobs were proven 
wrong.

This result was no surprise to economists. After all, the trend toward globalization has been going on for decades, not 
just since NAFTA. If trade did reduce the number of available jobs, then the United States should have been seeing a 
steady loss of jobs for decades. While the United States economy does experience rises and falls in unemployment 
rates—according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from spring 2008 to late 2009, the unemployment rate rose from 4.4% 
to 10%; it has since fallen back to 5.5% in spring 2015—the number of jobs is not falling over extended periods of 
time. The number of U.S. jobs rose from 71 million in 1970 to 138 million in 2012.
Protectionism certainly saves jobs in the specific industry being protected but, for two reasons, it costs jobs in 
other unprotected industries. First, if consumers are paying higher prices to the pro- tected industry, they inevitably 
have less money to spend on goods from other industries, and so jobs

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   765

are lost in those other industries. Second, if the protected product is sold to other firms, so that other firms must 
now pay a higher price for a key input, then those firms will lose sales to foreign producers who do not need to pay 
the higher price. Lost sales translate into lost jobs. The hidden opportunity cost of using protectionism to save jobs 
in one industry is jobs sacrificed in other industries. This is why the United States International Trade Commission, 
in its study of barriers to trade, predicts that reducing trade barriers would not lead to an overall loss of jobs. 
Protectionism reshuffles jobs from industries without import protections to industries that are protected from imports, 
but it does not create more jobs.

Moreover, the costs of saving jobs through protectionism can be very high. A number of different studies have attempted 
to estimate the cost to consumers in higher prices per job saved through pro- tectionism. Table 2 shows a sample of 
results, compiled by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Saving a job through protectionism typically 
costs much more than the actual worker’s salary. For example, a study published in 2002 compiled evidence that using 
protectionism to save an aver- age job in the textile and apparel industry would cost $199,000 per job saved. In other 
words, those workers could have been paid $100,000 per year to be unemployed and the cost would only be half of what it 
is to keep them working in the textile and apparel industry. This result is not unique to textiles and apparel.

Table 2. Cost to U.S. Consumers of Saving a Job through Protectionism (Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)

Why  does  it  cost  so  much  to  save  jobs  through  protectionism?  The  basic  reason  is  that  not  all  of the 
extra  money paid by consumers because  of tariffs or quotas  goes to save jobs. For example, if tariffs are imposed on 
steel imports so that buyers of steel pay a higher price, U.S. steel companies earn greater profits, buy more 
equipment, pay bigger bonuses to managers, give pay raises to existing employees—and also avoid firing some additional 
workers. Only part of the higher price of protected steel goes toward saving jobs. Also, when an industry is protected, 
the economy as a whole loses the benefits of playing to its comparative advantage—in other words, producing what it is 
best at. So, part of the higher price that consumers pay for protected goods is lost economic efficiency, which can be 
measured as another deadweight loss, like that discussed in Labor and Financial Markets.

There’s a bumper sticker that speaks to the threat some U.S. workers feel from imported products: “Buy  American—Save  
U.S.  Jobs.”  If  the  car  were  being  driven  by  an  economist,  the  sticker  might

766                   ERIK  DEAN, JUSTIN  ELARDO, MITCH  GREEN, BENJAMIN  WILSON, SEBASTIAN  BERGER 


declare: “Block Imports—Save Jobs for Some Americans, Lose Jobs for Other Americans, and Also Pay High Prices.”

TRADE AND WAGES

Even if trade does not reduce the number of jobs, it could affect wages. Here, it is important to sepa- rate issues 
about the average level of wages from issues about whether the wages of certain workers may be helped or hurt by trade.

Because trade raises the amount that an economy can produce by letting firms and workers play to their comparative 
advantage, trade will also cause the average level of wages in an economy to rise. Workers who can produce more will be 
more desirable to employers, which will shift the demand for their labor out to the right, and increase wages in the 
labor market. By contrast, barriers to trade will reduce the average level of wages in an economy.

However, even if trade increases the overall wage level, it will still benefit some workers and hurt oth- ers. Workers 
in industries that are confronted by competition from imported products may find that demand for their labor decreases 
and shifts back to the left, so that their wages decline with a rise in international trade. Conversely, workers in 
industries that benefit from selling in global markets may find that demand for their labor shifts out to the right, so 
that trade raises their wages.

One concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high-skilled, high-wage workers in the United States, it may 
also impose costs on low-skilled, low-wage workers. After all, high-skilled U.S. workers presumably benefit from 
increased sales of sophisticated products like computers, machin- ery, and pharmaceuticals in which the United States 
has a comparative advantage. Meanwhile, low- skilled U.S. workers must now compete against extremely low-wage workers 
worldwide for making simpler products like toys and clothing. As a result, the wages of low-skilled U.S. workers are 
likely to fall. There are, however, a number of reasons to believe that while globalization has helped some
U.S. industries  and hurt others, it has not focused its negative impact on the wages of low-skilled Americans. First, 
about half of U.S. trade is intra-industry trade. That means the U.S. trades simi- lar goods with other high-wage 
economies like Canada, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. For instance, in 2014 the U.S. exported over 2 million 
cars, from all the major automakers, and also imported several million cars from other countries.

Most U.S. workers in these industries have above-average skills and wages—and many of them do quite well in the world 
of globalization. Some evidence suggested that intra-industry trade between

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   767

similar  countries  had  a  small  impact  on  domestic  workers  but  later  evidence  indicates  that  it  all 
depends on how flexible the labor market is. In other words, the key is how flexible workers are in finding jobs in 
different industries. Trade on low-wage workers depends a lot on the structure of labor markets and indirect effects 
felt in other parts of the economy. For example, in the United States and the United Kingdom, because labor market 
frictions are low, the impact of trade on low income work- ers is small.

Second, many low-skilled U.S. workers hold service jobs that cannot be replaced by imports from low-wage countries. For 
example, lawn care services or moving and hauling services or hotel maids cannot be imported from countries long 
distances away like China or Bangladesh. Competition from imported products is not the primary determinant of their 
wages.

Finally, while the focus of the discussion here is on wages, it is worth pointing out that low-wage U.S. workers suffer 
due to protectionism in all the industries—even those that they do not work in the
U.S. For example, food and clothing are protected industries. These low-wage workers therefore pay higher prices for 
these basic necessities and as such their dollar stretches over fewer goods.

The benefits and costs of increased trade in terms of its effect on wages are not distributed evenly across the 
economy. However, the growth of international trade has helped to raise the productivity of U.S. workers as a whole—and 
thus helped to raise the average level of wages.

LABOR STANDARDS AND WORKING CONDITIONS

Workers in many low-income countries around the world labor under conditions that would be ille- gal for a worker in 
the United States. Workers in countries like China, Thailand, Brazil, South Africa, and Poland are often paid less than 
the United States minimum wage. For example, in the United States, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour; a typical wage 
in many low-income countries might be more like $7.25 per day, or often much less. Moreover, working conditions in 
low-income countries may be extremely unpleasant, or even unsafe. In the worst cases, production may involve the labor 
of small children or even workers who are treated nearly like slaves. These concerns over standards of foreign labor do 
not affect most of U.S. trade, which is intra-industry and carried out with other high- income countries that have 
labor standards similar to the United States, but it is, nonetheless, morally and economically important.

In  thinking  about  labor  standards  in  other  countries,  it  is  important  to  draw  some  distinctions between  
what  is  truly  unacceptable  and  what  is  painful  to  think  about.  Most  people,  economists included, have 
little difficulty with the idea that production by six-year-olds confined in factories or by slave labor is morally 
unacceptable. They would support aggressive efforts to eliminate such prac- tices—including shutting out imported 
products made with such labor. Many cases, however, are less clear-cut. An opinion article in the New York Times 
several years ago described the case of Ahmed Zia, a 14-year-old boy from Pakistan. He earned $2 per day working in a 
carpet factory. He dropped out of school in second grade. Should the United States and other countries refuse to 
purchase rugs made by Ahmed and his co-workers? If the carpet factories were to close, the likely alternative job for 
Ahmed is farm work, and as Ahmed says of his carpet-weaving job: “This makes much more money and is more comfortable.”

Other workers may have even less attractive alternative jobs, perhaps scavenging garbage or prostitu- tion. The real 
problem for Ahmed and many others in low-income countries is not that globalization

768                   ERIK  DEAN, JUSTIN  ELARDO, MITCH  GREEN, BENJAMIN  WILSON, SEBASTIAN  BERGER 


has made their lives worse, but rather that they have so few good life alternatives. The United States went through 
similar situations during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

In closing, there is some irony when the United States government or U.S. citizens take issue with labor standards in 
low-income countries, because the United States is not a world leader in govern- ment laws to protect employees. In 
Western European countries and Canada, all citizens are guar- anteed some form of national healthcare by the 
government; the United States does not offer such a guarantee but has moved in the direction of universal health 
insurance coverage under the recent Affordable Care Act. Many European workers receive six weeks or more of paid 
vacation per year; in the United States, vacations are often one to three weeks per year. If European countries accused 
the United States of using unfair labor standards to make U.S. products cheaply, and announced that they would shut out 
all U.S. imports until the United States adopted guaranteed national healthcare, added more national holidays, and 
doubled vacation time, Americans would be outraged. Yet when U.S. pro- tectionists start talking about restricting 
imports from poor countries because of low wage levels and poor working conditions, they are making a very similar 
argument. This is not to say that labor con- ditions in low-income countries are not an important issue. They are. 
However, linking labor condi- tions in low-income countries to trade deflects the emphasis from the real question to 
ask: “What are acceptable and enforceable minimum labor standards and protections to have the world over?”

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

As international trade increases, it contributes to a shift in jobs away from industries where that econ- omy does not 
have a comparative advantage and toward industries where it does have a comparative advantage. The degree to which 
trade affects labor markets has a lot to do with the structure of the labor market in that country and the adjustment 
process in other industries. Global trade should raise the average level of wages by increasing productivity. However, 
this increase in average wages may include both gains to workers in certain jobs and industries and losses to others.

In thinking about labor practices in low-income countries, it is useful to draw a line between what is unpleasant to 
think about and what is morally objectionable. For example, low wages and long work- ing hours in poor countries are 
unpleasant to think about, but for people in low-income parts of the world, it may well be the best option open to 
them. Practices like child labor and forced labor are morally objectionable and many countries refuse to import 
products made using these practices.

or leave the total number of jobs about the same?
2.    Is international trade likely to have roughly the same effect on the number of jobs in each individual industry?

SOLUTIONS


Answers to Self-Cfteck Questions

1.    Trade barriers raise the price of goods in protected industries. If those products are inputs in other 
industries, it raises their production costs and then prices, so sales fall in those other industries. Lower sales lead 
to lower employment. Additionally, if the protected industries are consumer goods, their customers pay higher prices, 
which reduce demand for other consumer products and thus employment in those industries.
2.    Trade based on comparative advantage raises the average wage rate economy-wide, though it can reduce the incomes 
of import-substituting industries. By moving away from a country’s comparative advantage, trade barriers do the 
opposite: they give workers in protected industries an advantage, while reducing the average wage economy-wide.
3.    By raising incomes, trade tends to raise working conditions also, even though those conditions may not (yet) be 
equivalent to those in high-income countries.

4.    They typically pay more than the next-best alternative. If a Nike firm did not pay workers at least as much as 
they would earn, for example, in a subsistence rural lifestyle, they many never come to work for Nike.
5.    Since trade barriers raise prices, real incomes fall. The average worker would also earn less.
6.    Workers working in other sectors and the protected sector see a decrease in their real wage.
