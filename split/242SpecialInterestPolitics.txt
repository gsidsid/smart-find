LEARNING OBJECTIVES



By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•    Explain how special interest groups and lobbyists can influence campaigns and elections

•    Describe pork-barrel spending and logrolling



any political issues are of intense interest to a relatively small group, as noted above. For example, many U.S. 
drivers do not much care where the tires for their car were made—they just  want  good  quality  as  inexpensively  as  
they  can  get  it.  In  September  2009,  President
Obama and Congress enacted a tariff (taxes added on imported goods) on tires imported from China that would increase 
the import price of Chinese tires by 35 percent in its first year, 30 percent in its second year, and 25 percent in its 
third year. Interestingly, the U.S. companies that make tires did not favor this step, because most of them also import 
tires from China and other countries. (See Global- ization and Protectionism for more on tariffs.) However, the United 
Steelworkers union, which had seen jobs in the tire industry fall by 5,000 over the previous five years, lobbied 
fiercely for the tariff to be enacted. With this tariff, the cost of all tires increased significantly. (See the 
closing Bring It Home feature at the end of this chapter for more information on the tire tariff.)

Special interest groups are groups that are small in number relative to the nation, but quite well orga- nized and 
focused on a specific issue. A special interest group can pressure legislators to enact public policies that do not 
benefit society as a whole. Imagine an environmental rule to reduce air pollution that will cost 10 large companies $8 
million each, for a total cost of $80 million. The social benefits from enacting this rule provide an average benefit 
of $10 for every person in the United States, for a total of about $3 trillion. Even though the benefits are far higher 
than the costs for society as a whole, the 10 companies are likely to lobby much more fiercely to avoid $8 million in 
costs than the average person is to argue for $10 worth of benefits.

As this example suggests, we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in 
Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities about economic policy with respect to negative externalities and 
pollution—the problem called regulatory capture (which we defined in Monop- oly and Antitrust Policy). In legislative 
bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes, or rules for safety 
in the workplace, or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations, you can be sure the specific industry 
affected has lobbyists who study every word and every comma. They talk with the legislators who are writing the 
legislation and suggest alternative wording. They contribute to the campaigns of legislators on the key commit-

tees—and may even offer those legislators high-paying jobs after they have left office. As a result, it often turns out 
that those who are being regulated can exercise considerable influence over the regu- lators.

In the early 2000s, about 40 million people in the United States were eligible for Medicare, a govern- ment program 
that provides health insurance for those 65 and older. On some issues, the elderly are a powerful interest group. They 
donate money and time to political campaigns, and in the 2012 pres- idential election, 70% of those over age 65 voted, 
while just 49% of those aged 18 to 24 cast a ballot, according to the U.S. Census.

In  2003,  Congress  passed  and  President  George  Bush  signed  into  law  a  substantial  expansion  of Medicare 
that helped the elderly to pay for prescription  drugs. The prescription  drug benefit cost the federal government 
about $40 billion in 2006, and the Medicare system projects that the annual cost will rise to $121 billion by 2016. The 
political pressure to pass a prescription drug benefit for Medicare was apparently quite high, while the political 
pressure to assist the 40 million with no health insurance at all was considerably lower. One reason might be that 
senior citizens are represented by AARP, a well-funded and well-organized lobbying group, while there is no umbrella 
organization to lobby for those without health insurance.

In the battle over passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA), which became known as “Oba- macare,” there was heavy 
lobbying on all sides by insurance companies and pharmaceutical compa- nies. However, a lobby group, Healtft Care for 
America Now (HCAN), was financed by labor unions and community groups and was organized to offset corporate lobbying. 
HCAN, spending $60 mil- lion dollars, was successful in helping to get the legislation passed which added new 
regulations on insurance companies and a mandate that all individuals will obtain health insurance by 2014. The fol- 
lowing Work It Out feature further explains voter incentives and lobbyist influence.


PAYING TO GET YOUR WAY

Suppose Congress proposes a tax on carbon emissions for certain factories in a small town of 10,000 people. The tax is 
estimated to reduce pollution to such an extent that it will benefit each resident by an equivalent of $300. The tax 
will also reduce profits to the town’s two large factories by $1 million each. How much should the factory owners be 
willing to spend to fight the passage of the tax, and how much should the townspeople be willing to pay to support it? 
Why is society unlikely to achieve the optimal outcome?
Step 1. The two factory owners each stand to lose $1 million if the tax is passed, so each should be willing to spend 
up to

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   687



that amount to prevent the passage of the tax, a combined sum of $2 million. Of course, in the real world, there is no 
guar- antee that lobbying efforts will be successful, so the factory owners may choose to invest an amount that is 
substantially lower.
Step 2. There are 10,000 townspeople, each standing to benefit by $300 if the tax passes. Theoretically, then, they 
should be willing to spend up to $3 million (10,000 × $300) to ensure passage. (Again, in the real world with no 
guarantees of success, they may choose to spend less.)
Step 3. It is costly and difficult for 10,000 people to coordinate in such a way as to influence public policy. Since 
each person stands to gain only $300, many may feel lobbying is not worth the effort.
Step  4.  The  two  factory  owners,  however,  find  it  very  easy  and  profitable  to  coordinate  their  
activities,  so  they  have  a greater incentive to do so.

Special interests may develop a close relationship with one political party, so their ability to influence legislation 
rises and falls as that party moves in or out of power. A special interest may even hurt a political party if it 
appears to a number of voters that the relationship is too cozy. In a close election, a small group that has been 
under-represented in the past may find that it can tip the election one way or another—so that group will suddenly 
receive considerable attention. Democratic institutions produce an ebb and flow of political parties and interests and 
thus offer both opportunities for special interests and ways of counterbalancing those interests over time.

IDENTIFIABLE WINNERS, ANONYMOUS LOSERS

A number of economic policies produce gains whose beneficiaries are easily identifiable, but costs that are partly or 
entirely shared by a large number who remain anonymous. A democratic political system probably has a bias toward those 
who are identifiable.

For  example,  policies  that  impose  price controls—like  rent  control—may  look  as  if  they  benefit renters and 
impose costs only on landlords. However, when landlords then decide to reduce the num- ber of rental units available in 
the area, a number of people who would have liked to rent an apartment end up living somewhere else because no units 
were available. These would-be renters have experi- enced a cost of rent control, but it is hard to identify who they 
are.

Similarly,  policies  that  block  imports  will  benefit  the  firms  that  would  have  competed  with  those 
imports—and workers at those firms—who are likely to be quite visible. Consumers who would have preferred to purchase 
the imported products, and who thus bear some costs of the protectionist pol- icy, are much less visible.

Specific tax breaks and spending programs also have identifiable winners and impose costs on others who are hard to 
identify. Special interests are more likely to arise from a group that is easily iden- tifiable, rather than from a 
group where some of those who suffer may not even recognize they are bearing costs.

PORK BARRELS AND LOGROLLING

Politicians have an incentive to ensure that government money is spent in their home state or district, where it will 
benefit their constituents in a direct and obvious way. Thus, when legislators are nego- tiating over whether to 
support a piece of legislation, they commonly ask each other to include pork- barrel spending, legislation  that 
benefits  mainly a single  political  district. Pork-barrel spending  is

688                   ERIK  DEAN, JUSTIN  ELARDO, MITCH  GREEN, BENJAMIN  WILSON, SEBASTIAN  BERGER 


another case in which democracy is challenged by concentrated benefits and widely dispersed costs: the benefits of 
pork-barrel spending are obvious and direct to local voters, while the costs are spread over the entire country. Read 
the following Clear It Up feature for more information on pork-barrel spending.


HOW MUCH IMPACT CAN PORK-BARREL SPENDING HAVE?

U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who was originally elected to the Senate in 1958 and served until 2010, 
is widely regarded as one of the masters of pork-barrel politics, directing a steady stream of federal funds to his 
home state. A journalist once compiled a list of structures in West Virginia at least partly funded by the government 
and named after Byrd: “the Robert C. Byrd Highway; the Robert C. Byrd Locks and Dam; the Robert C. Byrd Institute; the 
Robert C. Byrd Life Long Learning Center; the Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship Program; the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank 
Telescope; the Robert C. Byrd Institute for Advanced Flexible Manufacturing; the Robert C. Byrd Federal Courthouse; the 
Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center; the Robert C. Byrd Academic and Technology Center; the Robert C. Byrd United 
Technical Center; the Robert C. Byrd Federal Building; the Robert C. Byrd Drive; the Robert C. Byrd Hilltop Office 
Complex; the Robert C. Byrd Library; and the Robert C. Byrd Learning Resource Center; the Robert C. Byrd Rural Health 
Center.” This list does not include government-funded projects in West Virginia that were not named after Byrd. Of 
course, we would have to analyze each of these expenditures in detail to figure out whether they should be treated as 
pork-barrel spending or whether they provide widespread benefits that reach beyond West Virginia. At least some of 
them, or a portion of them, certainly would fall into that category. Because there are currently no term limits for 
Congressional representatives, those who have been in office longer generally have more power to enact pork-barrel 
projects.

The amount spent on individual pork-barrel projects is small, but many small projects can add up to a substantial 
total. A nonprofit watchdog organization, called Citizens against Government Waste, pro- duces an annual report, the 
Pig Book that attempts to quantify the amount of pork-barrel spending, focusing on items that were requested by only 
one member of Congress, that were passed into law without any public hearings, or that serve only a local purpose. 
Whether any specific item qualifies as pork can be controversial, of course, but at least by this measure, pork-barrel 
spending totaled $2.7 billion in 2014.

Pork-barrel spending can be encouraged by logrolling, an action in which all members of a group of legislators agree to 
vote for a package of otherwise unrelated laws that they individually favor. For example, if one member of the U.S. 
Congress suggests building a new bridge or hospital in his or her own congressional district, the other members might 
oppose it. However, if 51% of the legislators come together, they can pass a bill that includes a bridge or hospital 
for every one of their districts.

As a reflection of this interest of legislators in their own districts, the U.S. government has typically spread out 
its spending on military bases and weapons programs to congressional districts all across the country. In part, this is 
done to help create a situation that encourages members of Congress to vote in support of defense spending.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

Special interest politics arises when a relatively small group, called a special interest group, each of whose members 
has a large interest in a political outcome, devotes a lot of time and energy to lobby- ing for the group’s preferred 
choice. Meanwhile, the large majority, each of whose members has only a small interest in this issue, pays no 
attention.

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   689

Pork-barrel  spending  is  defined  as  legislation  whose  benefits  are  concentrated  on  a  single  district while  
the  costs  are  spread  widely  over  the  country.  Logrolling  refers  to  a  situation  in  which  two or more 
legislators agree to vote for each other’s legislation, which can then encourage pork-barrel spending in many 
districts.

SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS



1.    What is the main factor preventing a large community from influencing policy in the same way as a special 
interest group?
2.    Why might legislators vote to impose a tariff on Egyptian cotton, when consumers in their districts would benefit 
from its availability?



REVIEW QUESTIONS



1.    How can a small special interest group win in a situation of majority voting when the benefits it seeks flow only 
to a small group?
2.    How can pork-barrel spending occur in a situation of majority voting when it benefits only a small group?
3.    Why do legislators vote for spending projects in districts that are not their own?




CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS



1.    When Microsoft was founded, the company devoted very few resources to lobbying activities. After a high- profile 
antitrust case against it, however, the company began to lobby heavily. Why does it make financial sense for companies 
to invest in lobbyists?
2.    Special interest groups are often made up of representatives of competing firms. Why are competitors sometimes 
willing to cooperate in order to form lobbying associations?
3.    Special interests do not oppose regulations in all cases. The Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013 would require 
online merchants to collect sales taxes from their customers in other states. Why might a large online retailer like 
Amazon.com support such a measure?
4.    To ensure safety and efficacy, the Food and Drug Administration regulates the medicines that are allowed to be 
sold in the United States. Sometimes this means a drug must be tested for years before it is allowed to reach the 
market. The winners in this system are easily identifiable as those who are protected from unsafe drugs that might 
otherwise harm them. Who are the more anonymous losers who suffer from strict medical regulations?
5.    How is it possible to bear a cost without realizing it? What are some examples of policies that affect people in 
ways they may not even be aware of?
6.    Is pork-barrel spending always a bad thing? Can you think of some examples of pork-barrel projects, perhaps from 
your own district, that have had positive results?

PROBLEMS



Say that the government is considering a ban on smoking in restaurants in Tobaccoville. There are 1 million people 
living there, and each would benefit by $200 from this smoking ban. However, there are two large tobacco companies in 
Tobaccoville and the ban would cost them $5 million each. What are the total costs and benefits of this proposed 
policy? Do you think it will be passed?
