OCCUPY WALL STREET

In September 2011, a group of protesters gathered in Zuccotti Park in New York City to decry what they perceived as 
increasing  social  and  economic  inequality  in  the  United  States.  Calling  their  protest  “Occupy  Wall  
Street,”  they  argued that  the  concentration  of  wealth  among  the  richest  1%  in  the  United  States  was  
both  economically  unsustainable  and inequitable, and needed to be changed. The protest then spread to other major 
cities, and the Occupy movement was born. Why were people so upset? How much wealth is concentrated among the top 1% in 
our society? How did they acquire so much wealth? These are very real, very important questions in the United States 
now, and this chapter on poverty and eco- nomic inequality will help us address the causes behind this sentiment.

he labor markets that determine what workers are paid do not take into account how much income a family needs for food, 
shelter, clothing, and health care. Market forces do not worry  about  what  happens  to  families  when  a  major  
local  employer  goes  out  of  business.  Market  forces do not take time to contemplate whether those who are earning 
higher incomes should pay an
even higher share of taxes.

However, labor markets do create considerable inequalities of income. In 2014, the median American family income was 
$57,939 (the median is the level where half of all families had more than that level and half had less). According to 
the U.S. Census Bureau, almost nine million U.S. families were clas- sified by the federal government as being below 
the poverty line in that year. Think about a family of three—perhaps a single mother with two children—attempting to 
pay for the basics of life on perhaps
$17,916 per year. After paying for rent, healthcare, clothing, and transportation, such a family might have $6,000 to 
spend on food. Spread over 365 days, the food budget for the entire family would be about $17 per day. To put this in 
perspective, most cities have restaurants where $17 will buy you an appetizer for one.

This chapter explores how the U.S. government defines poverty, the balance between assisting the poor  without  
discouraging  work,  and  how  federal  antipoverty  programs  work.  It  also  discusses income  inequality—how  
economists  measure  inequality,  why  inequality  has  changed  in  recent decades, the range of possible government 
policies to reduce inequality, and the danger of a tradeoff that too great a reduction in inequality may reduce 
incentives for producing output.



20.1  DRAWING  THE  POVERTY  LINE



LEARNING OBJECTIVES



By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•    Explain economic inequality and how the poverty line is determined

•    Analyze the U.S. poverty rate over time, noting its prevalence among different groups of citizens



omparisons  of  high  and  low  incomes  raise  two  different  issues:  economic  inequality  and poverty.  Poverty  
is  measured  by  the  number  of  people  who  fall  below  a  certain  level  of income—called the poverty line—that 
defines the income needed for a basic standard of liv-
ing. Income inequality compares the share of the total income (or wealth) in society that is received by different 
groups; for example, comparing the share of income received by the top 10% to the share of income received by the 
bottom 10%.

In the United States, the official definition of the poverty line traces back to a single person: Mollie Orsftansky. In 
1963, Orshansky, who was working for the Social Security Administration, published an article called “Children of the 
Poor” in a highly useful and dry-as-dust publication called the Social Security Bulletin. Orshansky’s idea was to 
define a poverty line based on the cost of a healthy diet.

Her previous job had been at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, where she had worked in an agency called the Bureau of 
Home Economics and Human Nutrition. One task of this bureau had been to calculate how much it would cost to feed a 
nutritionally adequate diet to a family. Orshansky found that the average family spent one-third of its income on food. 
She then proposed that the poverty line be the amount needed to buy a nutritionally adequate diet, given the size of 
the family, multiplied by three.

The current U.S. poverty line is essentially the same as the Orshansky poverty line, although the dollar amounts are 
adjusted each year to represent the same buying power over time. The U.S. poverty line in 2015 ranged from $11,790 for 
a single individual to $25,240 for a household of four people.

Figure 1 shows the U.S. poverty rate over time; that is, the percentage of the population below the poverty line in any 
given year. The poverty rate declined through the 1960s, rose in the early 1980s and early 1990s, but seems to have 
been slightly lower since the mid-1990s. However, in no year in the last four decades has the poverty rate been less 
than 11% of the U.S. population—that is, at best about one American in nine is below the poverty line. In recent years, 
the poverty rate appears to have peaked at 15.9% in 2011 before dropping to 14.5% in 2013. Table 1 compares poverty 
rates for differ- ent groups in 2011. As you will see when we delve further into these numbers, poverty rates are rela-

tively low for whites, for the elderly, for the well-educated, and for male-headed households. Poverty rates for 
females, Hispanics, and African Americans are much higher than for whites. While Hispan- ics and African Americans have 
a higher percentage of individuals living in poverty than others, most people in the United States living below the 
poverty line are white.

the 1960 levels. In 2013, the poverty dropped slightly to 14.5%. (Source: U.S. Census Bureau)

Table 1. Poverty Rates by Group, 2013

The concept of a poverty line raises many tricky questions. In a vast country like the United States, should there be a 
national poverty line? After all, according to the Federal Register, the median house- hold income for a family of four 
was $102,552 in New Jersey and $57,132 in Mississippi in 2013, and prices of some basic goods like housing are quite 
different between states. The poverty line is based on cash income, which means it does not take into account 
government programs that provide assistance to the poor in a non-cash form, like Medicaid (health care for low-income 
individuals and families) and food aid. Also, low-income families can qualify for federal housing assistance. (These 
and other government aid programs will be discussed in detail later in this chapter.)

Should the poverty line be adjusted to take the value of such programs into account? Many economists and policymakers 
wonder whether the concept of what poverty means in the twenty-first century should be rethought. The following Clear 
It Up feature explains the poverty lines set by the World Bank for low-income countries around the world.


HOW IS POVERTY MEASURED IN LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES?

The World Bank sets two poverty lines for low-income countries around the world. One poverty line is set at an income 
of
$1.25/day per person; the other is at $2/day. By comparison, the U.S. 2015 poverty line of $20,090 annually for a 
family of three works out to $18.35 per person per day.
Clearly, many people around the world are far poorer than Americans, as Table 2 shows. China and India both have more 
than a billion people; Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa; and Egypt is the most populous country in the 
Middle East. In all four of those countries, in the mid-2000s, a substantial share of the population subsisted on less 
than $2/day. Indeed, about half the world lives on less than $2.50 a day, and 80 percent of the world lives on less 
than $10 per day. (Of course, the cost of food, clothing, and shelter in those countries can be very different from 
those costs in the United States, so the $2 and $2.50 figures may mean greater purchasing power than they would in the 
United States.)

Any poverty line will be somewhat arbitrary, and it is useful to have a poverty line whose basic defi- nition does not 
change much over time. If Congress voted every few years to redefine what poverty means, then it would be difficult to 
compare rates over time. After all, would a lower poverty rate mean that the definition had been changed, or that 
people were actually better off? Government sta- tisticians at the U.S. Census Bureau have ongoing research programs to 
address questions like these.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

Wages are influenced by supply and demand in labor markets, which can lead to very low incomes for some people and very 
high incomes for others. Poverty and income inequality are not the same thing. Poverty applies to the condition of 
people who cannot afford the necessities of life. Income inequality refers to the disparity between those with higher 
and lower incomes. The poverty rate is what per- centage of the population lives below the poverty line, which is 
determined by the amount of income that it takes to purchase the necessities of life. Choosing a poverty line will 
always be somewhat con- troversial.

SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS



Describe how each of these changes is likely to affect poverty and inequality:

a.    Incomes rise for low-income and high-income workers, but rise more for the high-income earners.
b.    Incomes fall for low-income and high-income workers, but fall more for high-income earners.




REVIEW QUESTIONS



1.    How is the poverty rate calculated?
2.    What is the poverty line?
3.    What is the difference between poverty and income inequality?

CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS



1.    What goods and services would you include in an estimate of the basic necessities for a family of four?
2.    If a family of three earned $20,000, would they be able to make ends meet given the official poverty threshold?



PROBLEMS



1.    In country A, the population is 300 million and 50 million people are living below the poverty line. What is the 
poverty rate?
2.    In country B, the population is 900 million and 100 million people are living below the poverty line. What is the 
poverty rate?
