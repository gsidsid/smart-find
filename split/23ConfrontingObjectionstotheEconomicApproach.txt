LEARNING OBJECTIVES



By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•    Analyze arguments against economic approaches to decision-making

•    Interpret a tradeoff diagram

•    Contrast normative statements and positive statements



t is one thing to understand the economic approach to decision-making and another thing to feel comfortable applying 
it. The sources of discomfort typically fall into two categories: that people do not act in the way that fits the 
economic way of thinking, and that even if people did act that
way, they should try not to. Let’s consider these arguments in turn.

FIRST OBJECTION: PEOPLE, FIRMS, AND SOCIETY DO NOT ACT LIKE THIS

The economic approach to decision-making seems to require more information than most individ- uals possess and more 
careful decision-making than most individuals actually display. After all, do you or any of your friends draw a budget 
constraint and mutter to yourself about maximizing util- ity before you head to the shopping mall? Do members of the 
U.S. Congress contemplate production possibilities frontiers before they vote on the annual budget? The messy ways in 
which people and societies operate somehow doesn’t look much like neat budget constraints or smoothly curving pro- 
duction possibilities frontiers.

However, the economics approach can be a useful way to analyze and understand the tradeoffs of economic decisions even 
so. To appreciate this point, imagine for a moment that you are playing bas- ketball, dribbling to the right, and 
throwing a bounce-pass to the left to a teammate who is running toward the basket. A physicist or engineer could work 
out the correct speed and trajectory for the pass, given the different movements involved and the weight and bounciness 
of the ball. But when you are playing basketball, you do not perform any of these calculations. You just pass the ball, 
and if you are a good player, you will do so with high accuracy.

Someone might argue: “The scientist’s formula of the bounce-pass requires a far greater knowledge of physics and far 
more specific information about speeds of movement and weights than the basket- ball player actually has, so it must be 
an unrealistic description of how basketball passes are actually made.” This reaction would be wrongheaded. The fact 
that a good player can throw the ball accurately

because of practice and skill, without making a physics calculation, does not mean that the physics calculation is 
wrong.

Similarly, from an economic point of view, someone who goes shopping for groceries every week has a great deal of 
practice with how to purchase the combination of goods that will provide that person with utility, even if the shopper 
does not phrase decisions in terms of a budget constraint. Govern- ment institutions may work imperfectly and slowly, 
but in general, a democratic form of government feels pressure from voters and social institutions to make the choices 
that are most widely preferred by people in that society. So, when thinking about the economic actions of groups of 
people, firms, and  society,  it  is  reasonable,  as  a  first  approximation,  to  analyze  them  with  the  tools  
of  economic analysis. For more on this, read about behavioral economics in the chapter on Consumer Choices.

SECOND OBJECTION: PEOPLE, FIRMS, AND SOCIETY SHOULD NOT ACT THIS WAY

The economics approach portrays people as self-interested. For some critics of this approach, even if self-interest is 
an accurate description of how people behave, these behaviors are not moral. Instead, the critics argue that people 
should be taught to care more deeply about others. Economists offer sev- eral answers to these concerns.

First, economics is not a form of moral instruction. Rather, it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually 
exists. Philosophers draw a distinction between positive statements, which describe the world as it is, and normative 
statements, which describe how the world should be. For example, an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in 
a certain city. If the expected benefits exceed the costs, he concludes that the project is worth doing—an example of 
positive analysis. Another econ- omist argues for extended unemployment compensation during the Great Depression 
because a rich country like the United States should take care of its less fortunate citizens—an example of normative 
analysis.

Even  if  the  line  between  positive  and  normative  statements  is  not  always  crystal  clear,  economic analysis 
does try to remain rooted in the study of the actual people who inhabit the actual economy. Fortunately  however,  the  
assumption  that  individuals  are  purely  self-interested  is  a  simplification about  human  nature.  In  fact,  we 
 need  to  look  no  further  than  to  Adam Smitft,  the  very  father  of modern economics to find evidence of this. 
The opening sentence of his book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, puts it very clearly: “How selfish soever man may be 
supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render 
their happiness nec- essary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.” Clearly, 
individuals are both self-interested and altruistic.

Second, self-interested behavior and profit-seeking can be labeled with other names, such as personal choice and 
freedom. The ability to make personal choices about buying, working, and saving is an important personal freedom. Some 
people may choose high-pressure, high-paying jobs so that they can earn and spend a lot of money on themselves. Others 
may earn a lot of money and give it to char- ity or spend it on their friends and family. Others may devote themselves 
to a career that can require a great deal of time, energy, and expertise but does not offer high financial rewards, 
like being an ele- mentary school teacher or a social worker. Still others may choose a job that does not take lots of 
their time or provide a high level of income, but still leaves time for family, friends, and contemplation. Some people 
may prefer to work for a large company; others might want to start their own business. People’s freedom to make their 
own economic choices has a moral value worth respecting.

IS A DIAGRAM BY ANY OTHER NAME THE SAME?

When you study economics, you may feel buried under an avalanche of diagrams: diagrams in the text, diagrams in the 
lec- tures, diagrams in the problems, and diagrams on exams. Your goal should be to recognize the common underlying 
logic and pattern of the diagrams, not to memorize each of the individual diagrams.
This chapter uses only one basic diagram, although it is presented with different sets of labels. The consumption 
budget constraint and the production possibilities frontier for society, as a whole, are the same basic diagram. Figure 
1 shows an individual budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier for two goods, Good 1 and Good 2. The 
tradeoff dia- gram always illustrates three basic themes: scarcity, tradeoffs, and economic efficiency.
The first theme is scarcity. It is not feasible to have unlimited amounts of both goods. But even if the budget 
constraint or
a PPF shifts, scarcity remains—just at a different level. The second theme is tradeoffs. As depicted in the budget 
constraint or the production possibilities frontier, it is necessary to give up some of one good to gain more of the 
other good. The details of this tradeoff vary. In a budget constraint, the tradeoff is determined by the relative 
prices of the goods: that is, the relative price of two goods in the consumption choice budget constraint. These 
tradeoffs appear as a straight line. However, the tradeoffs in many production possibilities frontiers are represented 
by a curved line because the law of diminishing returns holds that as resources are added to an area, the marginal 
gains tend to diminish. Regardless of the specific shape, tradeoffs remain.
The third theme is economic efficiency, or getting the most benefit from scarce resources. All choices on the 
production
possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because in such cases, there is no way to increase the quantity of 
one good without decreasing the quantity of the other. Similarly, when an individual makes a choice along a budget 
constraint, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other. The 
choice on a production possibilities set that is socially preferred, or the choice on an individual’s budget constraint 
that is personally preferred, will display allocative efficiency.
The  basic  budget  constraint/production  possibilities  frontier  diagram  will  recur  throughout  this  book.  Some 
 examples include  using  these  tradeoff  diagrams  to  analyze  trade,  labor  supply  versus  leisure,  saving  
versus  consumption,  envi- ronmental protection and economic output, equality of incomes and economic output, and the 
macroeconomic tradeoff between consumption and investment. Do not be confused by the different labels. The budget 
constraint/production pos- sibilities frontier diagram is always just a tool for thinking carefully about scarcity, 
tradeoffs, and efficiency in a particular situation.

Third, self-interested behavior can lead to positive social results. For example, when people work hard to make a 
living, they create economic output. Consumers who are looking for the best deals will encourage businesses to offer 
goods and services that meet their needs. Adam Smith, writing in The Wealth of Nations, christened this property the 
invisible ftand. In describing how consumers and pro- ducers interact in a market economy, Smith wrote:

Every individual…generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much  he is promoting 
it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his  own security; and by 
directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain. And 
he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention…By 
pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to 
promote it.

The metaphor of the invisible hand suggests the remarkable possibility that broader social good can emerge from selfish 
individual actions.

Fourth, even people who focus on their own self-interest in the economic part of their life often set

Figure 1. The Tradeoff Diagram. Both the individual opportunity set (or budget constraint) and the social production 
possi- bilities frontier show the constraints under which individual consumers and society as a whole operate. Both

aside their own narrow self-interest in other parts of life. For example, you might focus on your own self-interest 
when asking your employer for a raise or negotiating to buy a car. But then you might turn around and focus on other 
people when you volunteer to read stories at the local library, help a friend move to a new apartment, or donate money 
to a charity. Self-interest is a reasonable starting point for analyzing many economic decisions, without needing to 
imply that people never do any- thing that is not in their own immediate self-interest.


CHOICES … TO WHAT DEGREE?

What have we learned? We know that scarcity impacts all the choices we make. So, an economist might argue that people 
do not go on to get bachelor’s degrees or master’s degrees because they do not have the resources to make those choices 
or because their incomes are too low and/or the price of these degrees is too high. A bachelor’s degree or a master’s 
degree may not be available in their opportunity set.
The price of these degrees may be too high not only because the actual price, college tuition (and perhaps room and 
board), is too high. An economist might also say that for many people, the full opportunity cost of a bachelor’s degree 
or a master’s degree is too high. For these people, they are unwilling or unable to make the tradeoff of giving up 
years of working, and earning an income, to earn a degree.
Finally, the statistics introduced at the start of the chapter reveal information about intertemporal cftoices. An 
economist
might say that people choose not to get a college degree because they may have to borrow money to go to college, and 
the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today. Also, it could be that some 
people have a preference for current consumption over future consumption, so they choose to work now at a lower salary 
and consume now, rather than putting that consumption off until after they graduate college.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

The economic way of thinking provides a useful approach to understanding human behavior. Econo- mists make the careful 
distinction between positive statements, which describe the world as it is, and normative statements, which describe 
how the world should be. Even when economics analyzes the gains and losses from various events or policies, and thus 
draws normative conclusions about how the world should be, the analysis of economics is rooted in a positive analysis 
of how people, firms, and governments actually behave, not how they should behave.

SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS



1.    Individuals may not act in the rational, calculating way described by the economic model of decision making, 
measuring utility and costs at the margin, but can you make a case that they behave approximately that way?
2.    Would an op-ed piece in a newspaper urging the adoption of a particular economic policy be considered a positive 
or normative statement?
3.    Would a research study on the effects of soft drink consumption on children’s cognitive development be considered 
a positive or normative statement?



REVIEW QUESTIONS



1.    What is the difference between a positive and a normative statement?
2.    Is the economic model of decision-making intended as a literal description of how individuals, firms, and the 
governments actually make decisions?
3.    What are four responses to the claim that people should not behave in the way described in this chapter?




CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS



1.    What assumptions about the economy must be true for the invisible hand to work? To what extent are those 
assumptions valid in the real world?
2.    Do economists have any particular expertise at making normative arguments? In other words, they have expertise at 
making positive statements (i.e., what will happen) about some economic policy, for example, but do they have special 
expertise to judge whether or not the policy should be undertaken?

SOLUTIONS


Answers to Self-Cfteck Questions

1.    When individuals compare cost per unit in the grocery store, or characteristics of one product versus another, 
they are behaving approximately like the model describes.
2.    Since an op-ed makes a case for what should be, it is considered normative.
3.    Assuming that the study is not taking an explicit position about whether soft drink consumption is good or bad, 
but just reporting the science, it would be considered positive.
