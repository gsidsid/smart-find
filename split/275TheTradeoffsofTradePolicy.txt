27.5  THE  TRADEOFFS  OF  TRADE  POLICY



LEARNING OBJECTIVES



By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•    Asses the complexity of international trade

•    Discuss why a market-oriented economy is so affected by international trade

•    Explain disruptive market change



conomists readily acknowledge that international trade is not all sunshine, roses, and happy endings. Over time, the 
average person gains from international trade, both as a worker who has greater productivity and higher wages because 
of the benefits of specialization and com-
parative advantage, and as a consumer who can benefit from shopping all over the world for a greater variety of quality 
products at attractive prices. The “average person,” however, is hypothetical, not real—representing a mix of those who 
have done very well, those who have done all right, and those who have done poorly. It is a legitimate concern of 
public policy to focus not just on the average or on the success stories, but also on those have not been so fortunate. 
Workers in other countries, the envi- ronment,  and  prospects  for  new  industries  and  materials  that  might  be  
of  key  importance  to  the national economy are also all legitimate issues.

The common belief among economists is that it is better to embrace the gains from trade, and then deal with the costs 
and tradeoffs with other policy tools, than it is to cut off trade to avoid the costs and tradeoffs.

To gain a better intuitive understanding for this argument, consider a hypothetical American com- pany  called  
Technotron.  Technotron  invents  a  new  scientific  technology  that  allows  the  firm  to increase the output and 
quality of its goods with a smaller number of workers at a lower cost. As a result of this technology, other U.S. firms 
in this industry will lose money and will also have to lay off workers—and some of the competing firms will even go 
bankrupt. Should the United States gov- ernment protect the existing firms and their employees by making it illegal for 
Technotron to use its new technology? Most people who live in market-oriented economies would oppose trying to block 
better products that lower the cost of services. Certainly, there is a case for society providing tempo- rary support 
and assistance for those who find themselves without work. Many would argue for gov- ernment support of programs that 
encourage retraining and acquiring additional skills. Government might also support research and development efforts, 
so that other firms may find ways of outdo- ing Technotron. Blocking the new technology altogether, however, seems like 
a mistake. After all, few people would advocate giving up electricity because it caused so much disruption to the 
kerosene and

candle business. Few would suggest holding back on improvements in medical technology because they might cause 
companies selling leeches and snake oil to lose money. In short, most people view disruptions due to technological 
change as a necessary cost that is worth bearing.

Now, imagine that Technotron’s new “technology” is as simple as this: the company imports what it sells from another 
country. In other words, think of foreign trade as a type of innovative technology. The  objective  situation  is  now  
exactly  the  same  as  before.  Because  of  Technotron’s  new  technol- ogy—which in this case is importing goods 
from another county—other firms in this industry will lose money and lay off workers. Just as it would have been 
inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of new scientific technology by trying to shut it 
down, it would be inappro- priate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of international trade by trying 
to restrict trade.

Some workers and firms will suffer because of international trade. In a living, breathing market-ori- ented economy, 
some workers and firms will always be experiencing disruptions, for a wide variety of reasons. Corporate management can 
be better or worse. Workers for a certain firm can be more productive or less. Tough domestic competitors can create 
just as much disruption as tough foreign competitors. Sometimes a new product is a hit with consumers; sometimes it is 
a flop. Sometimes a company is blessed by a run of good luck or stricken with a run of bad luck. For some firms, 
interna- tional trade will offer great opportunities for expanding productivity and jobs; for other firms, trade will 
impose stress and pain. The disruption caused by international trade is not fundamentally differ- ent from all the 
other disruptions caused by the other workings of a market economy.

In other words, the economic analysis of free trade does not rely on a belief that foreign trade is not disruptive or 
does not pose tradeoffs; indeed, the story of Technotron begins with a particular dis- ruptive market cftange—a new 
technology—that causes real tradeoffs. In thinking about the disrup- tions of foreign trade, or any of the other 
possible costs and tradeoffs of foreign trade discussed in this chapter, the best public policy solutions typically do 
not involve protectionism, but instead involve finding ways for public policy to address the particular issues, while 
still allowing the benefits of inter- national trade to occur.


WHAT’S THE DOWNSIDE OF PROTECTION?

The domestic flat-panel display industry employed many workers before the ITC imposed the dumping margin tax. Flat- 
panel displays make up a significant portion of the cost of producing laptop computers—as much as 50%. Therefore, the 
antidumping tax would substantially increase the cost, and thus the price, of U.S.-manufactured laptops. As a result of 
the ITC’s decision, Apple moved its domestic manufacturing plant for Macintosh computers to Ireland (where it had an 
exist- ing plant). Toshiba shut down its U.S. manufacturing plant for laptops. And IBM cancelled plans to open a laptop 
manufac- turing plant in North Carolina, instead deciding to expand production at its plant in Japan. In this case, 
rather than having the desired effect of protecting U.S. interests and giving domestic manufacturing an advantage over 
items manufactured elsewhere, it had the unintended effect of driving the manufacturing completely out of the country. 
Many people lost their jobs and most flat-panel display production now occurs in countries other than the United 
States.


KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

International trade certainly has income distribution effects. This is hardly surprising. All domestic or international 
competitive market forces are disruptive. They cause companies and industries to rise

and fall. Government has a role to play in cushioning workers against the disruptions of the market. However, just as 
it would be unwise in the long term to clamp down on new technology and other causes of disruption in domestic markets, 
it would be unwise to clamp down on foreign trade. In both cases, the disruption brings with it economic benefits.

SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS



1.    How does competition, whether domestic or foreign, harm businesses?
2.    What are the gains from competition?




REVIEW QUESTIONS



1.    Who gains and who loses from trade?
2.    Why is trade a good thing if some people lose?
3.    What are some ways that governments can help people who lose from trade?




CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS



1.    What are some examples of innovative products that have disrupted their industries for the better?
2.    In principle, the benefits of international trade to a country exceed the costs, no matter whether the country is 
importing or exporting. In practice, it is not always possible to compensate the losers in a country, for example, 
workers who lose their jobs due to foreign imports. In your opinion, does that mean that trade should be inhibited to 
prevent the losses?
3.    Economists sometimes say that protectionism is the “second-best” choice for dealing with any particular problem. 
What they mean is that there is often a policy choice that is more direct or effective for dealing with the problem—a 
choice that would still allow the benefits of trade to occur. Explain why protectionism is a “second-best” choice for:

a.    helping workers as a group
b.    helping industries stay strong
c.    protecting the environment
d.    advancing national defense

4.    Trade has income distribution effects. For example, suppose that because of a government-negotiated reduction in 
trade barriers, trade between Germany and the Czech Republic increases. Germany sells house paint to the Czech 
Republic. The Czech Republic sells alarm clocks to Germany. Would you expect this pattern of trade to increase or 
decrease jobs and wages in the paint industry in Germany? The alarm clock industry in Germany? The paint industry in 
Czech Republic? The alarm clock industry in Czech Republic? What has to happen for there to be no increase in total 
unemployment in both countries?

GLOSSARY

disruptive market cftange innovative new product or production technology which disrupts the status quo in a market, 
leading the innovators to earn more income and profits and the other firms to lose income and profits, unless they can 
come up with their own innovations

SOLUTIONS



Answers to Self-Cfteck Questions

1.    Competition from firms with better or cheaper products can reduce a business’s profits, and may drive it out of 
business. Workers would similarly lose income or even their jobs.
2.    Consumers get better or less expensive products. Businesses with the better or cheaper products increase their 
profits. Employees of those businesses earn more income. On balance, the gains outweigh the losses to a nation.
