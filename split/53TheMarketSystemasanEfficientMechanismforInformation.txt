5.3  THE  MARKET  SYSTEM  AS  AN  EFFICIENT  MECHANISM  FOR INFORMATION



LEARNING OBJECTIVES


By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•    Apply demand and supply models to analyze prices and quantities
•    Explain the effects of price controls on the equilibrium of prices and quantities



rices exist in markets for goods and services, for labor, and for financial capital. In all of these markets, prices 
serve as a remarkable social mechanism for collecting, combining, and trans- mitting information that is relevant to 
the market—namely, the relationship between demand
and supply—and then serving as messengers to convey that information to buyers and sellers. In a market-oriented  
economy,  no  government  agency  or  guiding  intelligence  oversees  the  set  of responses  and  interconnections  
that  result  from  a  change  in  price.  Instead,  each  consumer  reacts according to that person’s preferences and 
budget set, and each profit-seeking producer reacts to the impact on its expected profits. The following Clear It Up 
feature examines the demand and supply models.


WHY ARE DEMAND AND SUPPLY CURVES IMPORTANT?

The demand and supply model is the second fundamental diagram for this course. (The opportunity set model introduced in 
the Choice in a World of Scarcity chapter was the first.) Just as it would be foolish to try to learn the arithmetic of 
long division by memorizing every possible combination of numbers that can be divided by each other, it would be 
foolish to try to memorize every specific example of demand and supply in this chapter, this textbook, or this course. 
Demand and supply is not primarily a list of examples; it is a model to analyze prices and quantities. Even though 
demand and supply diagrams have many labels, they are fundamentally the same in their logic. Your goal should be to 
understand the underly- ing model so you can use it to analyze any market.
Figure 1 displays a generic demand and supply curve. The horizontal axis shows the different measures of quantity: a 
quan- tity of a good or service, or a quantity of labor for a given job, or a quantity of financial capital. The 
vertical axis shows a measure of price: the price of a good or service, the wage in the labor market, or the rate of 
return (like the interest rate) in the financial market.
The  demand  and  supply  model  can  explain  the  existing  levels  of  prices,  wages,  and  rates  of  return.  To  
carry  out  such an analysis, think about the quantity that will be demanded at each price and the quantity that will 
be supplied at each price—that is, think about the shape of the demand and supply curves—and how these forces will 
combine to produce equilibrium.

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   153
Demand and supply can also be used to explain how economic events will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates of 
return. There are only four possibilities: the change in any single event may cause the demand curve to shift right or 
to shift left; or it may cause the supply curve to shift right or to shift left. The key to analyzing the effect of an 
economic event on equilibrium prices and quantities is to determine which of these four possibilities occurred. The way 
to do this correctly is to think back to the list of factors that shift the demand and supply curves. Note that if more 
than one variable is changing at the same time, the overall impact will depend on the degree of the shifts; when there 
are multiple variables, economists isolate each change and analyze it independently.
























Figure 1. Demand and Supply Curves. The figure displays a generic demand and sup- ply curve. The horizontal axis shows 
the different measures of quantity: a quantity of a good or service, a quantity of labor for a given job, or a quantity 
of financial capital. The vertical axis shows a measure of price: the price of a good or service, the wage in the labor 
market, or the rate of return (like the interest rate) in the financial mar- ket. The demand and supply curves can be 
used to explain how economic events will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates of return.


An increase in the price of some product signals consumers that there is a shortage and the product should  perhaps  be 
 economized  on.  For  example,  if  you  are  thinking  about  taking  a  plane  trip  to Hawaii, but the ticket turns 
out to be expensive during the week you intend to go, you might consider other weeks when the ticket might be cheaper. 
The price could be high because you were planning to travel during a holiday when demand for traveling is high. Or, 
maybe the cost of an input like jet fuel increased or the airline has raised the price temporarily to see how many 
people are willing to pay it. Perhaps all of these factors are present at the same time. You do not need to analyze the 
market and break down the price change into its underlying factors. You just have to look at the price of a ticket and 
decide whether and when to fly.

In the same way, price changes provide useful information to producers. Imagine the situation of a farmer who grows 
oats and learns that the price of oats has risen. The higher price could be due to an

154                   ERIK  DEAN, JUSTIN  ELARDO, MITCH  GREEN, BENJAMIN  WILSON, SEBASTIAN  BERGER 

increase in demand caused by a new scientific study proclaiming that eating oats is especially health- ful. Or perhaps 
the price of a substitute grain, like corn, has risen, and people have responded by buy- ing more oats. But the oat 
farmer does not need to know the details. The farmer only needs to know that the price of oats has risen and that it 
will be profitable to expand production as a result.

The actions of individual consumers and producers as they react to prices overlap and interlock in markets for goods, 
labor, and financial capital. A change in any single market is transmitted through these multiple interconnections to 
other markets. The vision of the role of flexible prices helping mar- kets to reach equilibrium and linking different 
markets together helps to explain why price controls can be so counterproductive. Price controls are government laws 
that serve to regulate prices rather than allow the various markets to determine prices. There is an old proverb: 
“Don’t kill the messen- ger.” In ancient times, messengers carried information between distant cities and kingdoms. 
When they brought bad news, there was an emotional impulse to kill the messenger. But killing the messen- ger did not 
kill the bad news. Moreover, killing the messenger had an undesirable side effect: Other messengers would refuse to 
bring news to that city or kingdom, depriving its citizens of vital infor- mation.

Those who seek price controls are trying to kill the messenger—or at least to stifle an unwelcome message that prices 
are bringing about the equilibrium level of price and quantity. But price controls do nothing to affect the underlying 
forces of demand and supply, and this can have serious reper- cussions. During China’s “Great Leap Forward” in the late 
1950s, food prices were kept artificially low, with the result that 30 to 40 million people died of starvation because 
the low prices depressed farm production. Changes in demand and supply will continue to reveal themselves through con- 
sumers’  and  producers’  behavior.  Immobilizing  the  price  messenger  through  price  controls  will deprive 
everyone in the economy of critical information. Without this information, it becomes diffi- cult for everyone—buyers 
and sellers alike—to react in a flexible and appropriate manner as changes occur throughout the economy.


BABY BOOMERS COME OF AGE

The theory of supply and demand can explain what happens in the labor markets and suggests that the demand for nurses 
will increase as healthcare needs of baby boomers increase, as Figure 2 shows. The impact of that increase will result 
in an average salary higher than the $67,930 earned in 2012 referenced in the first part of this case. The new 
equilibrium (E1) will be at the new equilibrium price (Pe1).Equilibrium quantity will also increase from Qe0 to Qe1.
Suppose that as the demand for nurses increases, the supply shrinks due to an increasing number of nurses entering 
retire- ment and increases in the tuition of nursing degrees. The impact of a decreasing supply of nurses is captured 
by the left- ward shift of the supply curve in Figure 3 The shifts in the two curves result in higher salaries for 
nurses, but the overall impact in the quantity of nurses is uncertain, as it depends on the relative shifts of supply 
and demand.
While we do not know if the number of nurses will increase or decrease relative to their initial employment, we know 
they will have higher salaries. The situation of the labor market for nurses described in the beginning of the chapter 
is different from this example, because instead of a shrinking supply, we had the supply growing at a lower rate than 
the growth in demand. Since both curves were shifting to the right, we would have an unequivocal increase in the 
quantity of nurses. And because the shift in the demand curve was larger than the one in the supply, we would expect 
higher wages as a result.


KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

Figure 2. Impact of Increasing Demand for Nurses 2012-2022. In 2012, the median salary for nurses was $67,930. As 
demand for services increases, the demand curve shifts to the right (from D0 to D1) and the equilibrium quantity of 
nurses increases from Qe0 to Qe1. The equi- librium salary increases from Pe0 to Pe1.

relative scarcities of goods, services, labor, and financial capital. Market participants do not need to know why 
prices have changed, only that the changes require them to revisit previous decisions they made about supply and 
demand. Price controls hide information about the true scarcity of products and thereby cause misallocation of 
resources.

Figure 3. Impact of Decreasing Supply of Nurses between 2012 and 2022. Initially, salaries increase as demand for 
nursing increases to Pe1. When demand increases, so too does the equi- librium quantity, from Qe0 to Qe1. The decrease 
in the supply of nurses due to nurses retiring from the workforce and fewer nursing graduates (ceterus paribus), causes 
a leftward shift of the supply curve resulting in even higher salaries for nurses, at Pe2, but an uncertain outcome for 
the equilibrium quantity of nurses, which in this representation is less than Qe1, but more than the initial Qe0.

REVIEW QUESTIONS


Whether the product market or the labor market, what happens to the equilibrium price and quantity for each of the four 
possibilities: increase in demand, decrease in demand, increase in supply, and decrease in supply.



CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS


1.    Why are the factors that shift the demand for a product different from the factors that shift the demand for 
labor? Why are the factors that shift the supply of a product different from those that shift the supply of labor?
2.    During a discussion several years ago on building a pipeline to Alaska to carry natural gas, the U.S. Senate 
passed a bill stipulating that there should be a guaranteed minimum price for the natural gas that would be carried 
through the pipeline. The thinking behind the bill was that if private firms had a guaranteed price for their natural 
gas, they would be more willing to drill for gas and to pay to build the pipeline.

a.    Using the demand and supply framework, predict the effects of this price floor on the price, quantity demanded, 
and quantity supplied.
b.    With the enactment of this price floor for natural gas, what are some of the likely unintended consequences in 
the market?
c.    Suggest some policies other than the price floor that the government can pursue if it wishes to encourage 
drilling for natural gas and for a new pipeline in Alaska.



PROBLEMS


1.    Imagine that to preserve the traditional way of life in small fishing villages, a government decides to impose a 
price floor that will guarantee all fishermen a certain price for their catch.

a.    Using the demand and supply framework, predict the effects on the price, quantity demanded, and quantity 
supplied.
b.    With the enactment of this price floor for fish, what are some of the likely unintended consequences in the 
market?
c.    Suggest some policies other than the price floor to make it possible for small fishing villages to continue.

2.    What happens to the price and the quantity bought and sold in the cocoa market if countries producing cocoa 
experience a drought and a new study is released demonstrating the health benefits of cocoa? Illustrate your answer 
with a demand and supply graph.

1.    A price floor prevents a price from falling below a certain level, but has no effect on prices above that level. 
It will have its biggest effect in creating excess supply (as measured by the entire area inside the dotted lines on 
the graph, from D to S) if it is substantially above the equilibrium price. This is illustrated in the following 
figure.



















Figure 4.

It will have a lesser effect if it is slightly above the equilibrium price. This is illustrated in the next figure.



















Figure 5.

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   159
It will have no effect if it is set either slightly or substantially below the equilibrium price, since an equilib- 
rium price above a price floor will not be affected by that price floor. The following figure illustrates these 
situations.




















Figure 6.

2.    A price ceiling prevents a price from rising above a certain level, but has no effect on prices below that level. 
It will have its biggest effect in creating excess demand if it is substantially below the equilibrium price. The 
following figure illustrates these situations.
















Figure 7.

When the price ceiling is set substantially or slightly above the equilibrium price, it will have no effect on creating 
excess demand. The following figure illustrates these situations.
3.    Neither. A shift in demand or supply means that at every price, either a greater or a lower quantity is demanded 
or supplied. A price floor does not shift a demand curve or a supply curve. However, if the price

Figure 8.


floor is set above the equilibrium, it will cause the quantity supplied on the supply curve to be greater than the 
quantity demanded on the demand curve, leading to excess supply.
4.    Neither. A shift in demand or supply means that at every price, either a greater or a lower quantity is demanded 
or supplied. A price ceiling does not shift a demand curve or a supply curve. However, if the price ceiling is set 
below the equilibrium, it will cause the quantity demanded on the demand curve to be greater than the quantity supplied 
on the supply curve, leading to excess demand.
