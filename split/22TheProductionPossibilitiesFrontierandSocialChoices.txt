ust as individuals cannot have everything they want and must instead make choices, society as a whole cannot have 
everything it might want, either. This section of the chapter will explain the constraints faced by society, using a 
model called the production possibilities frontier (PPF).
There are more similarities than differences between individual choice and social choice. As you read this section, 
focus on the similarities.

Because society has limited resources (e.g., labor, land, capital, raw materials) at any point in time, there is a 
limit to the quantities of goods and services it can produce. Suppose a society desires two products, healthcare and 
education. This situation is illustrated by the production possibilities fron- tier in Figure 1.

In Figure 1, healthcare is shown on the vertical axis and education is shown on the horizontal axis. If the society 
were to allocate all of its resources to healthcare, it could produce at point A. But it would not have any resources 
to produce education. If it were to allocate all of its resources to educa- tion, it could produce at point F. 
Alternatively, the society could choose to produce any combination of healthcare and education shown on the production 
possibilities frontier. In effect, the production possibilities frontier plays the same role for society as the budget 
constraint plays for Alphonso. Soci- ety can choose any combination of the two goods on or inside the PPF. But it does 
not have enough resources to produce outside the PPF.

Most important, the production possibilities frontier clearly shows the tradeoff between healthcare and education. 
Suppose society has chosen to operate at point B, and it is considering producing more education. Because the PPF is 
downward sloping from left to right, the only way society can obtain more education is by giving up some healthcare. 
That is the tradeoff society faces. Suppose it consid-

Figure 1. A Healthcare vs. Education Production Possibilities Fron- tier. This production possibilities frontier shows 
a tradeoff between devoting social resources to healthcare and devoting them to edu- cation.  At  A  all  resources  go 
 to  healthcare  and  at  B,  most  go  to healthcare. At D most resources go to education, and at F, all go to 
education.

ers moving from point B to point C. What would the opportunity cost be for the additional education? The opportunity 
cost would be the healthcare society has to give up. Just as with Alphonso’s budget constraint, the opportunity cost is 
shown by the slope of the production possibilities frontier. By now you might be saying, “Hey, this PPF is sounding 
like the budget constraint.” If so, read the following Clear It Up feature.


WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BUDGET CONSTRAINT AND A PPF?

There are two major differences between a budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier. The first is the 
fact that the budget constraint is a straight line. This is because its slope is given by the relative prices of the 
two goods. In contrast, the PPF has a curved shape because of the law of the diminishing returns. The second is the 
absence of specific numbers on the axes of the PPF. There are no specific numbers because we do not know the exact 
amount of resources this imaginary economy has, nor do we know how many resources it takes to produce healthcare and 
how many resources it takes to produce education. If this were a real world example, that data would be available. An 
additional reason for the lack of numbers is that there is no single way to measure levels of education and healthcare. 
However, when you think of improvements in education, you can think of accomplishments like more years of school 
completed, fewer high-school dropouts, and higher scores on standardized tests. When you think of improvements in 
healthcare, you can think of longer life expectancies, lower levels of infant mortality, and fewer outbreaks of 
disease.
Whether  or  not  we  have  specific  numbers,  conceptually  we  can  measure  the  opportunity  cost  of  additional  
education as society moves from point B to point C on the PPF. The additional education is measured by the horizontal 
distance between B and C. The foregone healthcare is given by the vertical distance between B and C. The slope of the 
PPF between B and C is (approximately) the vertical distance (the “rise”) over the horizontal distance (the “run”). 
This is the opportunity cost of the additional education.

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                      41

THE SHAPE OF THE PPF AND THE LAW OF DIMINISHING RETURNS
The budget constraints presented earlier in this chapter, showing individual choices about what quan- tities of goods 
to consume, were all straight  lines. The reason for these straight  lines was that the slope of the budget constraint 
was determined by relative prices of the two goods in the consumption budget constraint. However, the production 
possibilities frontier for healthcare and education was drawn as a curved line. Why does the PPF have a different 
shape?

To understand why the PPF is curved, start by considering point A at the top left-hand side of the PPF.  At  point  A,  
all  available  resources  are  devoted  to  healthcare  and  none  are  left  for  education. This situation would be 
extreme and even ridiculous. For example, children are seeing a doctor every day, whether they are sick or not, but not 
attending school. People are having cosmetic surgery on every part of their bodies, but no high school or college 
education exists. Now imagine that some of these resources are diverted from healthcare to education, so that the 
economy is at point B instead of point A. Diverting  some  resources away from A to B causes relatively little  
reduction  in health because the last few marginal dollars going into healthcare services are not producing much addi- 
tional gain in health. However, putting those marginal dollars into education, which is completely without resources at 
point A, can produce relatively large gains. For this reason, the shape of the PPF from A to B is relatively flat, 
representing a relatively small drop-off in health and a relatively large gain in education.

Now consider the other end, at the lower right, of the production possibilities frontier. Imagine that society starts 
at choice D, which is devoting nearly all resources to education and very few to health- care, and moves to point F, 
which is devoting all spending to education and none to healthcare. For the sake of concreteness, you can imagine that 
in the movement from D to F, the last few doctors must become high school science teachers, the last few nurses must 
become school librarians rather than dispensers of vaccinations, and the last few emergency rooms are turned into 
kindergartens. The gains to education from adding these last few resources to education are very small. However, the 
opportunity cost lost to health will be fairly large, and thus the slope of the PPF between D and F is steep, showing a 
large drop in health for only a small gain in education.

The lesson is not that society is likely to make an extreme choice like devoting no resources to edu- cation at point A 
or no resources to health at point F. Instead, the lesson is that the gains from com- mitting additional marginal 
resources to education depend on how much is already being spent. If on the one hand, very few resources are currently 
committed to education, then an increase in resources used can bring relatively large gains. On the other hand, if a 
large number of resources are already committed to education, then committing additional resources will bring 
relatively smaller gains.

This pattern is common enough that it has been given a name: the law of diminisfting returns, which holds that as 
additional increments of resources are added to a certain purpose, the marginal benefit from those additional 
increments will decline. When government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime, for example, the original 
gains in reducing crime could be relatively large. But addi- tional increases typically cause relatively smaller 
reductions in crime, and paying for enough police and security to reduce crime to nothing at all would be tremendously 
expensive.

The curvature of the production possibilities frontier shows that as additional resources are added to education, 
moving from left to right along the horizontal axis, the original gains are fairly large, but gradually diminish. 
Similarly, as additional resources are added to healthcare, moving from bottom to top on the vertical axis, the 
original gains are fairly large, but again gradually diminish. In this way,

the law of diminishing returns produces the outward-bending shape of the production possibilities frontier.

PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ALLOCATIVE EFFICIENCY
The  study  of  economics  does  not  presume  to  tell  a  society  what  choice  it  should  make  along  its 
production possibilities frontier. In a market-oriented economy with a democratic government, the choice will involve a 
mixture of decisions by individuals, firms, and government. However, economics can point out that some choices are 
unambiguously better than others. This observation is based on the concept of efficiency. In everyday usage, efficiency 
refers to lack of waste. An inefficient machine operates  at  high  cost,  while  an  efficient  machine  operates  at  
lower  cost,  because  it  is  not  wasting energy or materials. An inefficient organization operates with long delays 
and high costs, while an efficient organization meets schedules, is focused, and performs within budget.

The production possibilities frontier can illustrate two kinds of efficiency: productive efficiency and allocative 
efficiency. Figure 2 illustrates these ideas using a production possibilities frontier between healthcare and 
education.



















Figure  2.  Productive  and  Allocative  Efficiency.  Productive  effi- ciency means it is impossible to produce more 
of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. Thus, all choices along a given PPF like 
B, C, and D display productive effi- ciency, but R does not. Allocative efficiency means that the particu- lar mix of 
goods being produced—that is, the specific choice along the production possibilities frontier—represents the allocation 
that society most desires.

Productive efficiency means that, given the available inputs and technology, it is impossible to pro- duce more of one 
good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. All choices on the PPF in Figure 2, including A, 
B, C, D, and F, display productive efficiency. As a firm moves from any one of these choices to any other, either 
healthcare increases and education decreases or vice

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                      43

versa. However, any choice inside the production possibilities frontier is productively inefficient and wasteful 
because it is possible to produce more of one good, the other good, or some combination of both goods.

For example, point R is productively inefficient because it is possible at choice C to have more of both goods: 
education on the horizontal axis is higher at point C than point R (E2 is greater than E1), and healthcare on the 
vertical axis is also higher at point C than point R (H2 is great than H1).

The particular mix of goods and services being produced—that is, the specific combination of health- care and education 
chosen along the production possibilities frontier—can be shown as a ray (line) from the origin to a specific point on 
the PPF. Output mixes that had more healthcare (and less edu- cation) would have a steeper ray, while those with more 
education (and less healthcare) would have a flatter ray.

Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods a society produces represents the com- bination that 
society most desires. How to determine what a society desires can be a controversial question, and is usually discussed 
in political science, sociology, and philosophy classes as well as in economics. At its most basic, allocative 
efficiency means producers supply the quantity of each prod- uct that consumers demand. Only one of the productively 
efficient choices will be the allocatively efficient choice for society as a whole.

WHY SOCIETY MUST CHOOSE
Every economy faces two situations in which it may be able to expand consumption of all goods. In the first case, a 
society may discover that it has been using its resources inefficiently, in which case by improving efficiency and 
producing on the production possibilities frontier, it can have more of all goods (or at least more of some and less of 
none). In the second case, as resources grow over a period of years (e.g., more labor and more capital), the economy 
grows. As it does, the production possibili- ties frontier for a society will tend to shift outward and society will be 
able to afford more of all goods.

But  improvements  in  productive  efficiency  take  time  to  discover  and  implement,  and  economic growth happens 
only gradually. So, a society must choose between tradeoffs in the present. For gov- ernment, this process often 
involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where reductions in spending would do 
the least harm. At the individual and firm level, the market economy coordinates a process in which firms seek to 
produce goods and services in the quantity, quality, and price that people want. But for both the government and the 
market economy in the short term, increases in production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere 
else in the economy.

THE PPF AND COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE
While every society must choose how much of each good it should produce, it does not need to pro- duce every single 
good it consumes. Often how much of a good a country decides to produce depends on how expensive it is to produce it 
versus buying it from a different country. As we saw earlier, the curvature of a country’s PPF gives us information 
about the tradeoff between devoting resources to producing one good versus another. In particular, its slope gives the 
opportunity cost of producing one more unit of the good in the x-axis in terms of the other good (in the y-axis). 
Countries tend to

44                     ERIK  DEAN, JUSTIN  ELARDO, MITCH  GREEN, BENJAMIN  WILSON, SEBASTIAN  BERGER 

have different opportunity costs of producing a specific good, either because of different climates, geography, 
technology or skills.

Suppose two countries, the US and Brazil, need to decide how much they will produce of two crops: sugar cane and wheat. 
Due to its climatic conditions, Brazil can produce a lot of sugar cane per acre but not much wheat. Conversely, the 
U.S. can produce a lot of wheat per acre, but not much sugar cane. Clearly, Brazil has a lower opportunity cost of 
producing sugar cane (in terms of wheat) than the U.S. The reverse is also true; the U.S. has a lower opportunity cost 
of producing wheat than Brazil. This can be illustrated by the PPFs of the two countries in Figure 3.




















Figure 3.  Production  Possibility  Frontier  for  the  U.S.  and  Brazil.  The  U.S.  PPF  is  flatter  than  the  
Brazil  PPF implying that the opportunity cost of wheat in term of sugar cane is lower in the U.S. than in Brazil. 
Conversely, the opportunity cost of sugar cane is lower in Brazil. The U.S. has comparative advantage in wheat and 
Brazil has comparative advantage in sugar cane.

When a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country, we say that this country has a 
comparative advantage in that good. In our example, Brazil has a comparative advantage in sugar cane and the U.S. has a 
comparative advantage in wheat. One can easily see this with a simple observation of the extreme production points in 
the PPFs of the two countries. If Brazil devoted all of its resources to producing wheat, it would be producing at 
point A. If however it had devoted all of its resources to producing sugar cane instead, it would be producing a much 
larger amount, at point B. By moving from point A to point B Brazil would give up a relatively small quantity in wheat 
production to obtain a large production in sugar cane. The opposite is true for the U.S. If the
U.S. moved from point A to B and produced only sugar cane, this would result in a large opportunity cost in terms of 
foregone wheat production.

The slope of the PPF gives the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of wheat. While the slope is not 
constant throughout the PPFs, it is quite apparent that the PPF in Brazil is much steeper than in the U.S., and 
therefore the opportunity cost of wheat generally higher in Brazil. In the chapter

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                      45

on International Trade you will learn that countries’ differences in comparative advantage determine which goods they 
will choose to produce and trade. When countries engage in trade, they specialize in the production of the goods that 
they have comparative advantage in, and trade part of that pro- duction for goods they do not have comparative 
advantage in. With trade, goods are produced where the opportunity cost is lowest, so total production increases, 
benefiting both trading parties.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
A  production  possibilities  frontier  defines  the  set  of  choices  society  faces  for  the  combinations  of 
goods  and  services  it  can  produce  given  the  resources  available.  The  shape  of  the  PPF  is  typically 
curved outward, rather than straight. Choices outside the PPF are unattainable and choices inside the PPF are wasteful. 
Over time, a growing economy will tend to shift the PPF outwards.

The law of diminishing returns holds that as increments of additional resources are devoted to pro- ducing something, 
the marginal increase in output will become smaller and smaller. All choices along a production possibilities frontier 
display productive efficiency; that is, it is impossible to use soci- ety’s resources to produce more of one good 
without decreasing production of the other good. The specific choice along a production possibilities frontier that 
reflects the mix of goods society prefers is the choice with allocative efficiency. The curvature of the PPF is likely 
to differ by country, which results in different countries having comparative advantage in different goods. Total 
production can increase if countries specialize in the goods they have comparative advantage in and trade some of their 
production for the remaining goods.

soldiers and civilians. How did the war affect Germany’s production possibilities curve?
2.    It is clear that productive inefficiency is a waste since resources are being used in a way that produces less

SOLUTIONS


Answers to Self-Cfteck Questions

1.    Because of the improvement in technology, the vertical intercept of the PPF would be at a higher level of 
healthcare. In other words, the PPF would rotate clockwise around the horizontal intercept. This would make the PPF 
steeper, corresponding to an increase in the opportunity cost of education, since resources devoted to education would 
now mean forgoing a greater quantity of healthcare.
2.    No. Allocative efficiency requires productive efficiency, because it pertains to choices along the production 
possibilities frontier.
3.    Both the budget constraint and the PPF show the constraint that each operates under. Both show a tradeoff between 
having more of one good but less of the other. Both show the opportunity cost graphically as the slope of the 
constraint (budget or PPF).
