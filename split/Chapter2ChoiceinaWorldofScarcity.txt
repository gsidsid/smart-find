INTRODUCTION  TO  CHOICE  IN  A  WORLD  OF  SCARCITY

CHOICES … TO WHAT DEGREE?

In 2015, the median income for workers who hold master’s degrees varies from males to females. The average of the two 
is
$2,951 weekly. Multiply this average by 52 weeks, and you get an average salary of $153,452. Compare that to the median 
weekly earnings for a full-time worker over 25 with no higher than a bachelor’s degree: $1,224 weekly and $63,648 a 
year. What about those with no higher than a high school diploma in 2015? They earn just $664 weekly and $34,528 over 
12 months. In other words, says the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), earning a bachelor’s degree boosted salaries 54% 
over what you would have earned if you had stopped your education after high school. A master’s degree yields a salary 
almost double that of a high school diploma.
Given these statistics, we might expect a lot of people to choose to go to college and at least earn a bachelor’s 
degree. Assum- ing that people want to improve their material well-being, it seems like they would make those choices 
that give them the greatest opportunity to consume goods and services. As it turns out, the analysis is not nearly as 
simple as this. In fact, in 2014, the BLS reported that while almost 88% of the population in the United States had a 
high school diploma, only 33.6% of 25–65 year olds had bachelor’s degrees, and only 7.4% of 25–65 year olds in 2014 had 
earned a master’s.

This brings us to the subject of this chapter: why people make the choices they make and how economists go about 
explain- ing those choices.


CHAPTER OBJECTIVES


Introduction to Cftoice in a World of Scarcity
In this chapter, you will learn about:

•    How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint

•    The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices

•    Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach



ou will learn quickly when you examine the relationship between economics and scarcity that choices involve tradeoffs. 
Every choice has a cost.

In 1968, the Rolling Stones recorded “You Can’t Always Get What You Want.” Economists chuckled, because  they  had  
been  singing  a  similar  tune  for  decades.  English  economist  Lionel  Robbins (1898–1984),  in  his  Essay  on  
the  Nature  and  Significance  of  Economic  Science  in  1932,  described  not always getting what you want in this 
way:

The time at our disposal is limited. There are only twenty-four hours in the day. We have to choose between the 
different uses to which they may be put. … Everywhere we turn, if we choose one thing we must relinquish others which, 
in different circumstances, we would wish not to have relinquished. Scarcity of means to satisfy given ends is an 
almost ubiquitous condition of human nature.

Because people live in a world of scarcity, they cannot have all the time, money, possessions, and expe- riences they 
wish. Neither can society.

This chapter will continue our discussion of scarcity and the economic way of thinking by first intro- ducing three 
critical concepts: opportunity cost, marginal decision making, and diminishing returns. Later, it will consider whether 
the economic way of thinking accurately describes either how choices are made or how they should be made.



2.1  HOW  INDIVIDUALS  MAKE  CHOICES  BASED  ON  THEIR BUDGET  CONSTRAINT



LEARNING OBJECTIVES



By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•    Calculate and graph budgets constraints

•    Explain opportunity sets and opportunity costs

•    Evaluate the law of diminishing marginal utility

•    Explain how marginal analysis and utility influence choices



onsider the typical consumer’s budget problem. Consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they 
need and want. Suppose Alphonso has $10 in spending money each week that he can allocate between bus tickets for 
getting to work and the burgers that he eats
for lunch. Burgers cost $2 each, and bus tickets are 50 cents each. Figure 1 shows Alphonso’s budget constraint, that 
is, the outer boundary of his opportunity set. The opportunity set identifies all the
opportunities for spending within his budget. The budget constraint indicates all the combinations of burgers and bus 
tickets Alphonso can afford when he exhausts his budget, given the prices of the two goods. (There are actually many 
different kinds of budget constraints. You will learn more about them in the chapter on Consumer Choices.)

The vertical axis in the figure shows burger purchases and the horizontal axis shows bus ticket pur- chases. If 
Alphonso spends all his money on burgers, he can afford five per week. ($10 per week/$2 per burger = 5 burgers per 
week.) But if he does this, he will not be able to afford any bus tickets. This choice (zero bus tickets and five 
burgers) is shown by point A in the figure. Alternatively, if Alphonso spends all his money on bus tickets, he can 
afford 20 per week. ($10 per week/$0.50 per bus ticket
= 20 bus tickets per week.) Then, however, he will not be able to afford any burgers. This alternative choice (20 bus 
tickets and zero burgers) is shown by point F.

If Alphonso is like most people, he will choose some combination that includes both bus tickets and burgers. That is, 
he will choose some combination on the budget constraint that connects points A and F. Every point on (or inside) the 
constraint shows a combination of burgers and bus tickets that Alphonso can afford. Any point outside the constraint is 
not affordable, because it would cost more money than Alphonso has in his budget.

The budget constraint clearly shows the tradeoff Alphonso faces in choosing between burgers and bus tickets. Suppose he 
is currently at point D, where he can afford 12 bus tickets and two burgers. What

Figure 1. The Budget Constraint: Alphonso’s Consump- tion  Choice  Opportunity  Frontier.  Each  point  on  the budget  
constraint  represents  a  combination  of  burgers and  bus  tickets  whose  total  cost  adds  up  to  Alphonso’s 
budget  of  $10.  The  slope  of  the  budget  constraint  is determined by the relative price of burgers and bus tick- 
ets. All along the budget set, giving up one burger means gaining four bus tickets.

would it cost Alphonso for one more burger? It would be natural to answer $2, but that’s not the way economists think. 
Instead they ask, how many bus tickets would Alphonso have to give up to get one more burger, while staying within his 
budget? The answer is four bus tickets. That is the true cost to Alphonso of one more burger.

THE CONCEPT OF OPPORTUNITY COST
Economists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what must be given up to obtain something that is desired. The 
idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else; in 
short, opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative. For Alphonso, the opportunity cost of a burger is 
the four bus tickets he would have to give up. He would decide whether or not to choose the burger depending on whether 
the value of the burger exceeds the value of the forgone alternative—in this case, bus tickets. Since people must 
choose, they inevitably face tradeoffs in which they have to give up things they desire to get other things they desire 
more.

A  fundamental  principle  of  economics  is  that  every  choice  has  an  opportunity  cost.  If  you  sleep through 
your economics class (not recommended, by the way), the opportunity cost is the learning

you miss from not attending class. If you spend your income on video games, you cannot spend it on movies. If you 
choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. In short, opportunity cost is all around 
us and part of human existence.

The following Work It Out feature shows a step-by-step analysis of a budget constraint calculation. Read through it to 
understand another important concept—slope—that is further explained in the appendix The Use of Mathematics in 
Principles of Economics.


UNDERSTANDING BUDGET CONSTRAINTS

Budget constraints are easy to understand if you apply a little math. The appendix The Use of Mathematics in Principles 
of Economics explains all the math you are likely to need in this book. So if math is not your strength, you might want 
to take a look at the appendix.
Step 1: The equation for any budget constraint is:

where P and Q are the price and quantity of items purchased and Budget is the amount of income one has to spend. Step 
2. Apply the budget constraint equation to the scenario. In Alphonso’s case, this works out to be:





Step 3. Using a little algebra, we can turn this into the familiar equation of a line:

For Alphonso, this is:


Step 4. Simplify the equation. Begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:




Step 5. Subtract one bus ticket from both sides:

Divide each side by 4 to yield the answer:




Step 6. Notice that this equation fits the budget constraint in Figure 1. The vertical intercept is 5 and the slope is 
–0.25, just as the equation says. If you plug 20 bus tickets into the equation, you get 0 burgers. If you plug other 
numbers of bus tickets into the equation, you get the results shown in Table 1, which are the points on Alphonso’s 
budget constraint.

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                      33




Point    Quantity of Burgers (at $2)    Quantity of Bus Tickets (at 50 cents)
A            5                                                    0 B            4                                      
              4
C            3                                                    8
D           2                                                    12

F            0                                                    20
Table 1.

Step 7. Notice that the slope of a budget constraint always shows the opportunity cost of the good which is on the 
hori- zontal axis. For Alphonso, the slope is −0.25, indicating that for every four bus tickets he buys, Alphonso must 
give up 1 burger.
There are two important observations here. First, the algebraic sign of the slope is negative, which means that the 
only way to get more of one good is to give up some of the other. Second, the slope is defined as the price of bus 
tickets (whatever is on the horizontal axis in the graph) divided by the price of burgers (whatever is on the vertical 
axis), in this case $0.50/$2
= 0.25. So if you want to determine the opportunity cost quickly, just divide the two prices.


IDENTIFYING OPPORTUNITY COST
In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price. If your cousin buys a new bicycle for 
$300, then $300 measures the amount of “other consumption” that he has given up. For practical purposes, there may be 
no special need to identify the specific alternative product or prod- ucts that could have been bought with that $300, 
but sometimes the price as measured in dollars may not accurately capture the true opportunity cost. This problem can 
loom especially large when costs of time are involved.

For example, consider a boss who decides that all employees will attend a two-day retreat to “build team spirit.” The 
out-of-pocket monetary cost of the event may involve hiring an outside consulting firm to run the retreat, as well as 
room and board for all participants. But an opportunity cost exists as well: during the two days of the retreat, none 
of the employees are doing any other work.

Attending college is another case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. The out-of- pocket costs of 
attending college include tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. But in addition, during the hours that 
you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a pay- ing job. Thus, college imposes both an 
out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost earnings.


WHAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY COST ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED AIRPORT SECURITY MEASURES?

After the terrorist plane hijackings on September 11, 2001, many steps were proposed to improve air travel safety. For 
example, the federal government could provide armed “sky marshals” who would travel inconspicuously with the rest of 
the passengers. The cost of having a sky marshal on every flight would be roughly $3 billion per year. Retrofitting all 
U.S. planes with reinforced cockpit doors to make it harder for terrorists to take over the plane would have a price 
tag of $450 million. Buying more sophisticated security equipment for airports, like three-dimensional baggage scanners 
and cameras linked to face recognition software, could cost another $2 billion.
But the single biggest cost of greater airline security does not involve spending money. It is the opportunity cost of 
addi-

34                     ERIK  DEAN, JUSTIN  ELARDO, MITCH  GREEN, BENJAMIN  WILSON, SEBASTIAN  BERGER 



tional waiting time at the airport. According to the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), more than 800 
million passengers took plane trips in the United States in 2012. Since the 9/11 hijackings, security screening has 
become more intensive, and consequently, the procedure takes longer than in the past. Say that, on average,  each air 
passenger spends an extra 30 minutes in the airport per trip. Economists commonly place a value on time to convert an 
opportunity cost in time into a monetary figure. Because many air travelers are relatively high-paid business people, 
conservative esti- mates set the average price of time for air travelers at $20 per hour. By these back-of-the-envelope 
calculations, the oppor- tunity cost of delays in airports could be as much as 800 million × 0.5 hours × $20/hour, or 
$8 billion per year. Clearly, the opportunity costs of waiting time can be just as important as costs that involve 
direct spending.

In some cases, realizing the opportunity cost can alter behavior. Imagine, for example, that you spend
$8 on lunch every day at work. You may know perfectly well that bringing a lunch from home would cost only $3 a day, so 
the opportunity cost of buying lunch at the restaurant is $5 each day (that is, the
$8 buying lunch costs minus the $3 your lunch from home would cost). $5 each day does not seem to be that much. 
However, if you project what that adds up to in a year—250 days a year × $5 per day equals $1,250, the cost, perhaps, 
of a decent vacation. If the opportunity cost is described as “a nice vacation” instead of “$5 a day,” you might make 
different choices.

MARGINAL DECISION-MAKING AND DIMINISHING MARGINAL UTILITY

The  budget  constraint  framework  helps  to  emphasize  that  most  choices  in  the  real  world  are  not about 
getting all of one thing or all of another; that is, they are not about choosing either the point at one end of the 
budget constraint or else the point all the way at the other end. Instead, most choices involve marginal analysis, 
which means comparing the benefits and costs of choosing a little more or a little less of a good.

People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods and services provide. Util- ity, as we 
will see in the chapter on Consumer Choices, is subjective but that does not make it less real. Economists typically 
assume that the more of some good one consumes (for example, slices of pizza), the more utility one obtains. At the 
same time, the utility a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more than the utility 
received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good. When Alphonso chooses between burgers and bus 
tickets, for example, the first few bus rides that he chooses might provide him with a great deal of utility—perhaps 
they help him get to a job interview or a doctor’s appointment. But later bus rides might provide much less 
utility—they may only serve to kill time on a rainy day. Similarly, the first burger that Alphonso chooses to buy may 
be on a day when he missed breakfast and is ravenously hungry. However, if Alphonso has a burger every single day, the 
last few burgers may taste pretty boring. The general pattern that consumption of the first few units of any good tends 
to bring a higher level of utility to a person than consump- tion of later units is a common pattern. Economists refer 
to this pattern as the law of diminisfting marginal utility, which means that as a person receives more of a good, the 
additional (or marginal) utility from each additional unit of the good declines. In other words, the first slice of 
pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth.

The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing choices. You would 
not say, “My favorite food is ice cream, so I will eat nothing but ice cream from now on.” Instead, even if you get a 
very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclu- sively, the additional or marginal utility 
from those last few servings would not be very high. Simi- larly, most workers do not say: “I enjoy leisure, so I’ll 
never work.” Instead, workers recognize that

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                      35

even though some leisure is very nice, a combination of all leisure and no income is not so attractive. The budget 
constraint framework suggests that when people make choices in a world of scarcity, they will use marginal analysis and 
think about whether they would prefer a little more or a little less.

SUNK COSTS

In the budget constraint framework, all decisions involve what will happen next: that is, what quan- tities of goods 
will you consume, how many hours will you work, or how much will you save. These decisions do not look back to past 
choices. Thus, the budget constraint framework assumes that sunk costs, which are costs that were incurred in the past 
and cannot be recovered, should not affect the current decision.

Consider the case of Selena, who pays $8 to see a movie, but after watching the film for 30 minutes, she knows that it 
is truly terrible. Should she stay and watch the rest of the movie because she paid for the ticket, or should she 
leave? The money she spent is a sunk cost, and unless the theater manager is feeling kindly, Selena will not get a 
refund. But staying in the movie still means paying an opportunity cost in time. Her choice is whether to spend the 
next 90 minutes suffering through a cinematic dis- aster or to do something—anything—else. The lesson of sunk costs is 
to forget about the money and time that is irretrievably gone and instead to focus on the marginal costs and benefits 
of current and future options.

For people and firms alike, dealing with sunk costs can be frustrating. It often means admitting an earlier error in 
judgment. Many firms, for example, find it hard to give up on a new product that is doing poorly because they spent so 
much money in creating and launching the product. But the lesson of sunk costs is to ignore them and make decisions 
based on what will happen in the future.

FROM A MODEL WITH TWO GOODS TO ONE OF MANY GOODS

The budget constraint diagram containing just two goods, like most models used in this book, is not realistic. After 
all, in a modern economy people choose from thousands of goods. However, thinking about a model with many goods is a 
straightforward extension of what we discussed here. Instead of drawing just one budget constraint, showing the 
tradeoff between two goods, you can draw multi- ple budget constraints, showing the possible tradeoffs between many 
different pairs of goods. Or in more advanced classes in economics, you would use mathematical equations that include 
many possi- ble goods and services that can be purchased, together with their quantities and prices, and show how the 
total spending on all goods and services is limited to the overall budget available. The graph with two goods that was 
presented here clearly illustrates that every choice has an opportunity cost, which is the point that does carry over 
to the real world.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

Economists see the real world as one of scarcity: that is, a world in which people’s desires exceed what is possible. 
As a result, economic behavior involves tradeoffs in which individuals, firms, and soci- ety must give up something 
that they desire to obtain things that they desire more. Individuals face the tradeoff of what quantities of goods and 
services to consume. The budget constraint, which is the frontier of the opportunity set, illustrates the range of 
choices available. The slope of the budget con- straint is determined by the relative price of the choices. Choices 
beyond the budget constraint are not affordable.

36                     ERIK  DEAN, JUSTIN  ELARDO, MITCH  GREEN, BENJAMIN  WILSON, SEBASTIAN  BERGER 


Opportunity cost measures cost by what is given up in exchange. Sometimes opportunity cost can be measured in money, 
but it is often useful to consider time as well, or to measure it in terms of the actual resources that must be given 
up.

Most economic decisions and tradeoffs are not all-or-nothing. Instead, they involve marginal analysis, which means they 
are about decisions on the margin, involving a little more or a little less. The law of diminishing marginal utility 
points out that as a person receives more of something—whether it is a specific good or another resource—the additional 
marginal gains tend to become smaller. Because sunk costs occurred in the past and cannot be recovered, they should be 
disregarded in making cur- rent decisions.

SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS



Suppose Alphonso’s town raised the price of bus tickets to $1 per trip (while the price of burgers stayed at $2 and his 
budget remained $10 per week.) Draw Alphonso’s new budget constraint. What happens to the opportunity cost of bus 
tickets?



REVIEW QUESTIONS



1.    Explain why scarcity leads to tradeoffs.
2.    Explain why individuals make choices that are directly on the budget constraint, rather than inside the budget 
constraint or outside it.



CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS



Suppose Alphonso’s town raises the price of bus tickets from $0.50 to $1 and the price of burgers rises from $2 to $4. 
Why is the opportunity cost of bus tickets unchanged? Suppose Alphonso’s weekly spending money increases from $10 to 
$20. How is his budget constraint affected from all three changes? Explain.



PROBLEMS



Use this information to answer the following 4 questions: Marie has a weekly budget of $24, which she likes to spend on 
magazines and pies.

1.    If the price of a magazine is $4 each, what is the maximum number of magazines she could buy in a week?
2.    If the price of a pie is $12, what is the maximum number of pies she could buy in a week?
3.    Draw Marie’s budget constraint with pies on the horizontal axis and magazines on the vertical axis. What is the

SOLUTIONS


Answers to Self-Cfteck Questions
The opportunity cost of bus tickets is the number of burgers that must be given up to obtain one more bus ticket. 
Origi- nally, when the price of bus tickets was 50 cents per trip, this opportunity cost was 0.50/2 = .25 burgers. The 
reason for this is that at the original prices, one burger ($2) costs the same as four bus tickets ($0.50), so the 
opportunity cost of a burger is four bus tickets, and the opportunity cost of a bus ticket is .25 (the inverse of the 
opportunity cost of a burger). With the new, higher price of bus tickets, the opportunity cost rises to $1/$2 or 0.50. 
You can see this graphically since the slope of the new budget constraint is flatter than the original one. If Alphonso 
spends all of his budget on burg- ers, the higher price of bus tickets has no impact so the horizontal intercept of the 
budget constraint is the same. If he spends all of his budget on bus tickets, he can now afford only half as many, so 
the vertical intercept is half as much. In short, the budget constraint rotates clockwise around the horizontal 
intercept, flattening as it goes and the opportunity cost of bus tickets increases.
