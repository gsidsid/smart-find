Defining Economics: A Pluralistic Approacft




DEFINING  ECONOMICS:  A  PLURALISTIC  APPROACH



CHAPTER OBJECTIVES



In this chapter, you will learn about:

•    Multiple Definitions of Economics

•    Diversity of Paradigms in Economics

•    A Critical Examination of the Orthodox (Neoclassical) Definition of Economics

•    The Presentation of an Alternative Definition



3.1  THE  IMPORTANCE  OF  DEFINITIONS



LEARNING OBJECTIVES



By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•    Discuss how definitions provide theoretical direction.





The  presentation  of  an  alternative  definition  may  appear  generic,  even  unimportant.  A  definition often 
washes over a reader, leaving the reader influenced, but without any obvious new insight as to the intended meaning or 
implications of a word.   Worse, without proper guidance, a reader may interpret a definition differently than what is 
intended by the author, or in the case of economics, different  from  how  the  discipline  is  actually  employing  
the  definition.   Definitions  are,  however, important, potentially very important.  A definition has the potential 
to provide clarity.  At their best, definitions act like a compass, providing a lost reader with several potential 
directions from which to proceed.



3.2  MULTIPLE  PERSPECTIVES  REQUIRE  MULTIPLE  DEFINITIONS



LEARNING OBJECTIVES



By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•    Define the term paradigm.



he  importance  of  clarity  and  directionality  becomes  heightened  when  a  discipline  has  more than one 
potential definition.  The discipline of economics, similar to the other social sciences, does not ascribe to only one 
definition.  The definition of economics that is utilized by an econ-
omist will often depend on the paradigmatic perspective of the economist.

Paradigm – A school of thought.  It represents the boundary of a discipline, framing the types of questions and 
phenomena that will be analyzed, and the approach or method of study a theorist will employ.

The discipline of economics has more than one paradigm.  Not surprisingly, the discipline of econom- ics also has more 
than one definition.



3.3  A  BRIEF  SYNOPSIS  OF  DIFFERENT  ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES



LEARNING OBJECTIVES



By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•    Define the term ideology.

•    Describe the relationship between ideology and paradigms

•    Identify some of the differences between competing economic paradigms.



ultiple theoretical perspectives tend to create multiple ideas as to what economic questions, phenomena, and methods 
are most appropriate.  With paradigmatic differences come ideo- logical differences.

Ideology – The ideas, beliefs, subjective values, and prevailing world views that a person holds.  One’s ideology 
influences the way in which a person perceives what they believe is correct or incorrect about their social cir- 
cumstance or the larger world in which they live.

Broadly speaking, the discipline of economics is occupied by theorists who tend to fall within one of three categories.

1.   Conservative economists
2.   Progressive economists
3.   Radical economists

In terms of beliefs, while there is some crossover, the differences between each of the ideological per- spectives 
tends to be overwhelming.

Conservative Economists Believe…

•   That markets works well on their own without outside interference.
•   Because markets work well, a “Laissez-Faire” (Hands Off) view of markets is embraced.
•   Given the belief in well-functioning markets, it is also believed, overwhelmingly, that markets should be 
responsible for how societies allocate resources
•   Limited government involvement in markets is best because extensive government involvement is disruptive to market 
performance.

Progressive Economists Believe…

•   Markets should generally be responsible for the allocation of resources
•   Free markets generate inequality
•   Free markets are often unstable
•   Government intervention is necessary

Radical Economists Believe…

•   Market economies are classed based economic systems.
•   Class is determined by one’s position in the economy: owner, laborer, etc.
•   Market economies empower the wealthy, typically owners of assets.
•   Market economies exploit labor
•   Free market capitalism is unstable
•   Capitalism needs to be replaced




COMPETING PARADIGMATIC VIEWS

How might different economists address Different Microeconomic Issues?

1.    Consider the issue of Negative Externalities – When a third party suffers a loss from the actions of others.  For 
example, consider the massive social costs associated with carbon emissions and climate change.

•    Conservative Economists: Argue that the solution to market failure associated with externalities is to assign 
property rights. If the party causing or impacted by the externality has property rights, then markets and accurate 
prices emerge.
•    Progressive Economists: Argue that the government is needed to assist in correcting for externalities. Taxes and/ 
or regulations can be instituted that require producers of externalities to account for the social costs they have 
generated.
•    Radical Economists: Argue that externalities are pervasive in market economies.   Assigning property rights 
encourages producers of externalities to produce more negative externalities in an effort to extort payments from those 
afflicted.  Also it is impossible to tax and/or regulate all externalities.  An alternative to the market, as an 
allocative institution, is needed.


How might different economists address structural issues in economics?

1.    Consider the issue of Preferred Economic Institutional Structure(s),

•    Conservative Economists: Argue that the free market is the ideal institution for allocating resources to their 
best (socially optimal) outcomes. Advocate that government should be limited to institutions useful toward the defense 
of private property and the enforcement of economic contracts.

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                      59



•    Progressive Economists: Argue that as a result of market failure such as environmental pollution and significant 
unemployment, institutions, typically government institutions, are necessary in order to correct market failure and 
return markets to a more efficient allocation of resources.
•    Radical Economists: Argue that government institutions are an incomplete and ineffective mechanism for addressing 
market failure. Advocate for the creation of alternative institutions, such as worker cooperatives, that are designed 
to challenge and potentially supplant institutions favorable to the current operation of the economic system.


How might different economists address economic development issues?

1.    Consider the issue of Income Inequality,

•    Conservative Economists: Argue that income inequality arises from productivity differences that emerge between and 
among individuals.  Efforts to reduce inequality should be avoided as they distort incentives and market allocation.
•    Progressive Economists: Argue that income inequality results from social circumstances.  Children born into higher 
income (higher wealth) families have more opportunities available to garner both the resources and skills necessary for 
higher incomes.  Hence, these economists favor government programs that promote equality of opportunity.
•    Radical Economists: Argue that income inequality is a byproduct of a class-based economic system.  Also inequality 
is exacerbated by social circumstances.  Generally, they would support government programs that promote equality of 
opportunity, however, also argue that those programs cannot eliminate inequality in a system built upon inequality.


How might different economists address world economic issues?

1.    Consider the issue of Global Poverty,

•    Conservative Economists: Argue that free trade between nations will drive specialization and the expansion of 
material production, thus gradually reducing global poverty.
•    Progressive Economists: Argue for a degree of government intervention in international trade. Suggest trade via 
such policies as infant industry, fair labor standards, and environmental protections. Trade is an economic development 
tool.
•    Radical Economists: Argue that international trade worsens class tensions. Low wages in developing countries cause 
wages to decline in developed countries.  Poverty is a part of capitalism, free trade and/or managed trade cannot end 
global poverty.
