20.4  INCOME  INEQUALITY:  MEASUREMENT  AND  CAUSES



LEARNING OBJECTIVES



By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•    Explain the distribution of income, and analyze the sources of income inequality in a market economy

•    Measure income distribution in quintiles

•    Calculate and graph a Lorenz curve

•    Show income inequality through demand and supply diagrams



overty levels can be subjective based on the overall income levels of a country; typically poverty is measured based on 
a percentage of the median income. Income inequality, however, has to do with the distribution of that income, in terms 
of which group receives the most or the least
income. Income inequality involves comparing those with high incomes, middle incomes, and low incomes—not just looking 
at those below or near the poverty line. In turn, measuring income inequal- ity means dividing up the population into 
various groups and then comparing the groups, a task that can be carried out in several ways, as the next Clear It Up 
feature shows.


HOW DO YOU SEPARATE POVERTY AND INCOME INEQUALITY?

Poverty can change even when inequality does not move at all. Imagine a situation in which income for everyone in the 
population declines by 10%. Poverty would rise, since a greater share of the population would now fall below the 
poverty line. However, inequality would be the same, because everyone suffered the same proportional loss. Conversely, 
a general rise in income levels over time would keep inequality the same, but reduce poverty.
It  is  also  possible  for  income  inequality  to  change  without  affecting  the  poverty  rate.  Imagine  a  
situation  in  which  a large number of people who already have high incomes increase their incomes by even more. 
Inequality would rise as a result—but the number of people below the poverty line would remain unchanged.

Why did inequality of household income increase in the United States in recent decades? Indeed, a trend toward greater 
income inequality has occurred in many countries around the world, although the effect has been more powerful in the 
U.S. economy. Economists have focused their explanations for the increasing inequality on two factors that changed more 
or less continually from the 1970s into the 2000s. One set of explanations focuses on the changing shape of American 
households; the other focuses on greater inequality of wages, what some economists call “winner take all” labor mar- 
kets. We will begin with how we measure inequality, and then consider the explanations for growing inequality in the 
United States.

MEASURING INCOME DISTRIBUTION BY QUINTILES

One common way of measuring income inequality is to rank all households by income, from lowest to highest, and then to 
divide all households into five groups with equal numbers of people, known as quintiles. This calculation allows for 
measuring the distribution of income among the five groups compared to the total. The first quintile is the lowest 
fifth or 20%, the second quintile is the next low- est, and so on. Income inequality can be measured by comparing what 
share of the total income is earned by each quintile.

U.S. income distribution by quintile appears in Table 7. In 2011, for example, the bottom quintile of the income 
distribution received 3.2% of income; the second quintile received 8.4%; the third quin- tile, 14.3%; the fourth 
quintile, 23.0%; and the top quintile, 51.14%. The final column of Table 7 shows what share of income went to 
households in the top 5% of the income distribution: 22.3% in 2011. Over time, from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, 
the top fifth of the income distribution typically received between about 43% to 44% of all income. The share of income 
that the top fifth received then begins to rise. According to the Census Bureau, much of this increase in the share of 
income going to the top fifth can be traced to an increase in the share of income going to the top 5%. The quintile 
measure shows how income inequality has increased in recent decades.

Bureau, Table 2)

It can also be useful to divide the income distribution in ways other than quintiles; for example, into tenths or even 
into percentiles (that is, hundredths). A more detailed breakdown can provide addi- tional insights. For example, the 
last column of Table 7 shows the income received by the top 5% per- cent of the income distribution. Between 1980 and 
2013, the share of income going to the top 5% increased by 5.7 percentage points (from 16.5% in 1980 to 22.2% in 2013). 
From 1980 to 2013 the share of income going to the top quintile increased by 7.0 percentage points (from 44.1% in 1980 
to 51% in 2013). Thus, the top 20% of householders (the fifth quintile) received over half (51%) of all the income in 
the United States in 2013.

LORENZ CURVE

The data on income inequality can be presented in various ways. For example, you could draw a bar

graph that showed the share of income going to each fifth of the income distribution. Figure 1 pre- sents  an 
alternative way of showing inequality  data in what is called a Lorenz curve. The Lorenz curve shows the cumulative 
share of population on the horizontal axis and the cumulative percentage of total income received on the vertical axis.


















Figure 1. The Lorenz Curve. A Lorenz curve graphs the cumulative shares of income received by everyone up to a certain 
quintile. The income distribution in 1980 was closer to the perfect equality line than the income distribution in 
2011—that is, the U.S. income dis- tribution became more unequal over time.

Every Lorenz curve diagram begins with a line sloping up at a 45-degree angle, shown as a dashed line in Figure 1. The 
points along this line show what perfect equality of the income distribution looks like. It would mean, for example, 
that the bottom 20% of the income distribution receives 20% of the total income, the bottom 40% gets 40% of total 
income, and so on. The other lines reflect actual U.S. data on inequality for 1980 and 2011.

The trick in graphing a Lorenz curve is that you must change the shares of income for each specific quintile, which are 
shown in the first column of numbers in Table 8, into cumulative income, shown in the second column of numbers. For 
example, the bottom 40% of the cumulative income distribu- tion will be the sum of the first and second quintiles; the 
bottom 60% of the cumulative income dis- tribution will be the sum of the first, second, and third quintiles, and so 
on. The final entry in the cumulative income column needs to be 100%, because by definition, 100% of the population 
receives 100% of the income.

Table 8. Calculating the Lorenz Curve

In a Lorenz curve diagram, a more unequal distribution of income will loop farther down and away from the 45-degree 
line, while a more equal distribution of income will move the line closer to the 45-degree line. The greater inequality 
of the U.S. income distribution between 1980 and 2013 is illus- trated  in  Figure  1  because  the  Lorenz  curve  for 
 2013  is  farther  from  the  45-degree  line  than  the Lorenz curve for 1980. The Lorenz curve is a useful way of 
presenting the quintile data that provides an image of all the quintile data at once. The next Clear It Up feature 
shows how income inequality differs in various countries compared to the United States.


HOW DOES ECONOMIC INEQUALITY VARY AROUND THE WORLD?

The U.S. economy has a relatively high degree of income inequality by global standards. As Table 9 shows, based on a 
vari- ety of national surveys done for a selection of years in the last five years of the 2000s (with the exception of 
Germany, and adjusted to make the measures more comparable), the U.S. economy has greater inequality than Germany 
(along with most Western European countries). The region of the world with the highest level of income inequality is 
Latin America, illustrated in the numbers for Brazil and Mexico. The level of inequality in the United States is lower 
than in some of the low-income countries of the world, like China and Nigeria, or some middle-income countries like the 
Russian Federation. However, not all poor countries have highly unequal income distributions; India provides a 
counterexample.

CAUSES OF GROWING INEQUALITY: THE CHANGING COMPOSITION OF AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS

In 1970, 41% of married women were in the labor force, but by 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 56.7% 
of married women were in the labor force. One result of this trend is that more households have two earners. Moreover, 
it has become more common for one high earner to marry another high earner. A few decades ago, the common pattern 
featured a man with relatively high earn- ings, such as an executive or a doctor, marrying a woman who did not earn as 
much, like a secretary or a nurse. Often, the woman would leave paid employment, at least for a few years, to raise a 
fam- ily. However, now doctors are marrying doctors and executives are marrying executives, and moth- ers with 
high-powered careers are often returning to work while their children are quite young. This pattern of households with 
two high earners tends to increase the proportion of high-earning house- holds.

According to data in the National Journal, even as two-earner couples have increased, so have single- parent 
households. Of all U.S. families, 13.1% were headed by single mothers; the poverty rate among single-parent households 
tends to be relatively high.

These changes in family structure, including the growth of single-parent families who tend to be at the lower end of 
the income distribution, and the growth of two-career high-earner couples near the top end of the income distribution, 
account for roughly half of the rise in income inequality across households in recent decades.

CAUSES OF GROWING INEQUALITY: A SHIFT IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF WAGES

Another  factor  behind  the  rise  in  U.S.  income  inequality  is  that  earnings  have  become  less  equal since 
the late 1970s. In particular, the earnings of high-skilled labor relative to low-skilled labor have

PRINCIPLES  OF  ECONOMICS                                                                                   571
increased. Winner-take-all labor markets result from changes in technology, which have increased global  demand  for  
“stars,”—whether  the  best  CEO,  doctor,  basketball  player,  or  actor.  This  global demand pushes salaries far 
above productivity differences versus educational differences. One way to measure this change is to take the earnings 
of workers with at least a four-year college bachelor’s degree  (including  those  who  went  on  and  completed  an  
advanced  degree)  and  divide  them  by  the earnings of workers with only a high school degree. The result is that 
those in the 25–34 age bracket with college degrees earned about 1.67 times as much as high school graduates in 2010, 
up from 1.59 times in 1995, according to U.S. Census data. Winner-take-all labor market theory argues that the salary 
gap between the median and the top 1 percent is not due to educational differences.
Economists use the demand and supply model to reason through the most likely causes of this shift. According to the 
National Center for Education Statistics, in recent decades, the supply of U.S. work- ers with college degrees has 
increased substantially; for example, 840,000 four-year bachelor’s degrees were conferred on Americans  in 1970; in 
2009–2010,  1,602,480  such degrees were conferred—an increase of about 90%. In Figure 2, this shift in supply to the 
right, from S0  to S1, should result in a lower equilibrium wage for high-skilled labor. Thus, the increase in the 
price of high-skilled labor must be explained by a greater demand, like the movement from D0 to D1. Evidently, 
combining both the increase in supply and in demand has resulted in a shift from E0 to E1, and a resulting higher wage.



















Figure 2. Why Would Wages Rise for High-Skilled Labor? The proportion of workers attending col- lege has increased in 
recent decades, so the supply curve for high-skilled labor has shifted to the right, from S0 to S1. If the demand for 
high-skilled labor had remained at D0, then this shift in supply would have led to lower wages for high-skilled labor. 
However, the wages for high-skilled labor, especially if there is a large global demand, have increased even with the 
shift in supply to the right. The explana- tion must lie in a shift to the right in demand for high-skilled labor, from 
D0 to D1. The figure shows how a combination of the shift in supply, from S0 to S1, and the shift in demand, from D0 to 
D1, led to both an increase in the quantity of high-skilled labor hired and also to a rise in the wage for such labor, 
from W0 to W1.

What factors would cause the demand for high-skilled labor to rise? The most plausible explanation is that while the 
explosion in new information and communications technologies over the last several decades has helped many workers to 
become more productive, the benefits have been especially great for high-skilled workers like top business managers, 
consultants, and design professionals. The new technologies have also helped to encourage globalization, the remarkable 
increase in international trade over the last few decades, by making it more possible to learn about and coordinate 
economic interactions all around the world. In turn, the rising impact of foreign trade in the U.S. economy has opened 
up greater opportunities for high-skilled workers to sell their services around the world. And lower-skilled workers 
have to compete with a larger supply of similarly skilled workers around the globe.

The market for high-skilled labor can be viewed as a race between forces of supply and demand. Addi- tional education 
and on-the-job training will tend to increase the supply of high-skilled labor and to hold down its relative wage. 
Conversely, new technology and other economic trends like globalization tend to increase the demand for high-skilled 
labor and push up its relative wage. The greater inequal- ity of wages can be viewed as a sign that demand for skilled 
labor is increasing faster than supply. On the other hand, if the supply of lower skilled workers exceeds the demand, 
then average wages in the lower quintiles of the income distribution will decrease. The combination of forces in the 
high-skilled and low-skilled labor markets leads to increased income disparity.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY

Measuring inequality involves making comparisons across the entire distribution of income, not just the poor. One way 
of doing this is to divide the population into groups, like quintiles, and then calcu- late what share of income is 
received by each group. An alternative approach is to draw Lorenz curves, which compare the cumulative income actually 
received to a perfectly equal distribution of income. Income inequality in the United States increased substantially 
from the late 1970s and early 1980s into the 2000s. The two most common explanations cited by economists are changes in 
the structure of households that have led to more two-earner couples and single-parent families, and the effect of new 
information and communications technology on wages.

SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS



1.    A group of 10 people have the following annual incomes: $24,000, $18,000, $50,000, $100,000, $12,000,
$36,000, $80,000, $10,000, $24,000, $16,000. Calculate the share of total income received by each quintile of this 
income distribution. Do the top and bottom quintiles in this distribution have a greater or larger share of total 
income than the top and bottom quintiles of the U.S. income distribution?
2.    Table 10 shows the share of income going to each quintile of the income distribution for the United Kingdom in 
1979 and 1991. Use this data to calculate what the points on a Lorenz curve would be, and sketch the Lorenz curve. How 
did inequality in the United Kingdom shift over this time period? How can you see the patterns in the quintiles in the 
Lorenz curves?

explain how information technology can increase income inequality if it is a complement to high-income workers like 
salespeople and managers, but a substitute for low-income workers like file clerks and telephone receptionists.

income inequality.



REVIEW QUESTIONS



1.    Who is included in the top income quintile?
2.    What is measured on the two axes of a Lorenz curve?
3.    If a country had perfect income equality what would the Lorenz curve look like?
4.    How has the inequality of income changed in the U.S. economy since the late 1970s?
5.    What are some reasons why a certain degree of inequality of income would be expected in a market economy?
6.    What are the main reasons economists give for the increase in inequality of incomes?




CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS



1.    Explain how a country may experience greater equality in the distribution of income, yet still experience high 
rates of poverty Hint: Look at the Clear It Up “How is poverty measured in low-income countries?” and compare to Table 
7.
2.    The demand for skilled workers in the United States has been increasing. To increase the supply of skilled 
workers, many argue that immigration reform to allow more skilled labor into the United States is needed. Explain 
whether you agree or disagree.
3.    Explain a situation using the supply and demand for skilled labor in which the increased number of college 
graduates leads to depressed wages. Given the rising cost of going to college, explain why a college education will or 
will not increase income inequality.

households total, the bottom quintile will be the bottom two households, the second quintile will be the

third and fourth households, and so on up to the top quintile. The quintiles and percentage of total income for the 
data provided are shown in the following table. Comparing this distribution to the U.S. income distribution for 2005, 
the top quintile in the example has a smaller share of total income than in the U.S. distribution and the bottom 
quintile has a larger share. This pattern usually means that the income distribution in the example is more equal than 
the U.S. distribution.

2.    Just from glancing at the quintile information, it is fairly obvious that income inequality increased in the 
United Kingdom over this time: The top quintile is getting a lot more, and the lowest quintile is getting a bit less. 
Converting this information into a Lorenz curve, however, is a little trickier, because the Lorenz curve graphs the 
cumulative distribution, not the amount received by individual quintiles. Thus, as explained in the text, you have to 
add up the individual quintile data to convert the data to this form. The following table shows the actual calculations 
for the share of income in 1979 versus 1991. The figure following the table shows the perfect equality line and the 
Lorenz curves for 1979 and 1991. As shown, the income distribution in 1979 was closer to the perfect equality line than 
the income distribution in 1991—that is, the United Kingdom income distribution became more unequal over time.

3.    In the market for low-wage labor, information technology shifts the demand for low-wage labor to the left. One 
reason is that technology can often substitute for low-wage labor in certain kinds of telephone or bookkeeping jobs. In 
addition, information technology makes it easier for companies to manage connections with low-wage workers in other 
countries, thus reducing the demand for low-wage workers in the United States. In the market for high-wage labor, 
information technology shifts the demand for high- wage labor to the right. By using the new information and 
communications technologies, high-wage labor can become more productive and can oversee more tasks than before. The 
following figure illustrates these

two labor markets. The combination of lower wages for low-wage labor and higher wages for high-wage labor means greater 
inequality.

4.    In the market for low-wage labor, a skills program will shift supply to the left, which will tend to drive up 
wages for the remaining low-skill workers. In the market for high-wage labor, a skills program will shift supply to the 
right (because after the training program there are now more high-skilled workers at every wage), which will tend to 
drive down wages for high-skill workers. The combination of these two programs will result in a lesser degree of 
inequality. The following figure illustrates these two labor markets. In the market for high-wage labor, a skills 
program will shift supply to the right, which will tend to drive down wages for high-skill workers.
